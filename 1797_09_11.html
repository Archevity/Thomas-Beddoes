	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, [11]  September 1797</h2>
	
	

 <p>Dear Sir</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am much obliged to you for the very long &amp; particular letter which I rec<sup>d</sup> this morning  &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have not time to write at large now &ndash; You will see Rollo’s book &ndash; With all its parade, it is valuable, particularly Mr Cruickshank’s acc<sup>t</sup> of the effects of oxygenated marine salt  &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I wish you to send the inclosed  to any 4 surgeons or others who maybe likely to have tried the nitrous acid &amp; will communicate &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">My comp<sup>ts</sup> to all your family</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Yrs</p> 

<p>T.B.</p> 

<p>[Enclosure:]</p> 

<p>Sir,</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You probably know that Mr. Scot, of Bombay, was led by considerations, that need not be stated here, to try the nitrous acid in the venereal disease; that the experiment answered; and that it has been successfully imitated in England. </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In above fifty cases, many of them picked for the worst, the Surgeons of the Royal Hospital at Plymouth have found this acid certain, expeditious, and infinitely milder than mercury. Their mode of administration is extremely commodious. To a pint of water they add a drachm of strong nitrous acid, together with 4 or 6 ounces of simple syrup. This mixture is sucked through a glass tube. 1½ or 2 drachms of the strong acid, so diluted, have proved an adequate dose for the day.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Mr. Cruikshank of Woolwich ingeniously substituted bodies of analogous constitution. He represents the oxygenated muriate of potash, as more powerful than nitrous acid. It produced an inflammatory state of the system.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">What is here recapitulated, together with some suggestions, may be read at large in Considerations on factitious airs, parts IV. and v. Johnson; in Two cases of Diabetes, Dilly; and in Reports concerning the effects of nitrous acid, &amp;c Johnson. Above 100 bad cases stand attested, as cured, beyond all reasonable doubt. Some unsuccessful trials are noticed in the last pamphlet.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The mild action and general power of the acid, with the proportion of failures, render a fuller induction of facts and testimonies highly desirable. &ndash; It cannot have escaped you, that the pretentions of many quack medicines are rested on the occasional inefficacy of mercury, and on an overcharged representation of its baneful effects. It is therefore certain, that to establish the anti-venereal virtue of substances, not injurious to the constitution, would be giving a deadly blow to empirical imposture.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">By the co-operation of practitioners, a thousand cases might soon be collected. And it is hoped that you will not refuse your assistance to such an undertaking. The share I have had in conveying information to the public, very naturally led me to reflect on the speediest method of solving this problem; <i>how far the cure of lues can be justifiably entrusted</i> to the nitrous acid in the first instance. In consequence, I have taken the liberty of making the present application. I do not think that it can yet be deemed superfluous to collect more evidence, nor will the advantage of bringing the evidence together be disputed. There are persons, to whom every large design appears, by reason of its comprehensiveness, absurd. Others, I trust, will not condemn the idea of attempting to induce a large part of the medical profession, to unite in an enquiry of the highest interest.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Where the case prospers, the report should concisely state the symptoms, with the date and permanence of the cure. Appearances leading to a knowledge of the cause of failure should be noted. The nitrous acid (and the oxygenated muriate) will be found useful in various diseases.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">But as the collection here proposed, will be confined to siphylis, information on other subjects should be written separately.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">If any profits accrue, they shall be divided among charitable establishments for venereal patients. On this account it will not, I hope, be thought improper to request that communications be transmitted, free of expence, to Mr. Johnson, Bookseller, <i>72</i>, St. Paul’s Church-Yard, London.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I do not wish that any reports should be forwarded before Jan. 1798, If by the end of February, the number shall suffice for publication, they shall be immediately printed; or else returned.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">To render the task of editor as little disagreeable as possible, it is desired that all technical terms and quantities may be written at length, and the whole in a fair hand.</p> 

<p>Sept. 5, 1797   &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  Thomas Beddoes </p> 

<p>Be pleased to communicate this letter to any Physician, Surgeon or Apothecary of your acquaintance.</p> 

<p>[handwritten note written on the printed sheet:]</p> 
<p>Dear Sir</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I shall send you by Mrs Beddoes,  who takes her sister  to Atherstone  this week a number of these &amp; my pamphlet, which is gone to town for publication  &ndash; Mrs B. will pay her respects to Mrs Watt  to Mrs Keir  before her return</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am yours truly</p>
