	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Francis Douce, 24 March 1808</h2>
	
	
<p>Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I acknowledge with thanks your ready &amp; polite answer  &ndash; When you have leisure &amp; inclination to attend to my intrusive curiosity, I shall certainly be rejoiced &lt;to hear&gt; from you again &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The connection between the state of health &amp; the manners of respective periods will scarce receive material illustration till some closer union take place between antiquarian &amp; medical information &ndash; To make a beginning some experienced &amp; learned practitioners of medicine must be assisted by the antiquary; or some antiquary, assisted by a physician, must extract &amp; digest the scattered notices of ages &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am glad that I have so far followed the guides you deem good &ndash; particularly in a tract on consumption  &ndash; I had examined Mr Strutts  works diligently also Hollingshead,  those local antiquaries which I understood to be the most accurate &amp; enlightened, Sinclair’s statist<sup>l</sup> reports,  the modern illustrator of Shakespeare  &amp; various foreign authors &ndash; What fruit I have gathered, I sh<sup>d</sup> be very glad for a real antiquary to examine &ndash; You may deem it singular, that I sh<sup>d</sup>  have deduced &amp; recommended in the harsh winds of this season the very mufflers you figure in yr late 1<sup>st</sup> volume so far as they cover the air-passages, the mouth &amp; nostrils  &ndash; Hence I now see many infants hereabouts with them or veils, by which I hope &amp; think they escape severe colds, pleurisies &amp;c &ndash; I will immediately transmit to you a copy of that tract  &amp; inclose an order for another &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I was glad to find you confirming what I have stated in regard to acute disorders &ndash; my general opinion is that these are less fatal &amp; frequent, especially among the more opulent classes, but consumption, nervous complaints &amp; a feeling of feebleness or listlessness much more universal &ndash; It is I believe an undoubted fact that fever has almost disappeared among the troops, &amp; consumption vastly increased &ndash; This quite of late &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You will if you please to  the trouble some time, see at large what I have put in print &ndash; some of the points are that </p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>1.	Our ancestors were more active &amp; lived more in the air &ndash; </li>
<li>2.	That their houses were less confined, except perhaps the sleeping rooms &ndash; You seem to have adopted an opposite opinion &ndash; you must have better grounds than I can have &ndash; The very large chimney pieces, when chimneys came in, the less close joiners’ work, the want of plastered ceilings in many cases, looser windows are circumstances upon which I rest my belief == Down to Count Rumford’s improvements  we seem to have been contriving more &amp; more how to keep out the external air &ndash;</li>
<li>3.	Animal food, especially salted, was more in use &amp; vegetables (gardenstuff) much less &ndash; Qy did they take so much hot liquid, putting the supposed specific action of tea on the nerves aside &ndash;</li>
<li>4.	The opulent classes used their muscles more &ndash; which by physiological inference, must have made an immense difference in the whole constitution &ndash;</li>
<li>5.	They fretted their sensibility less &ndash; as by <em>less novel</em> reading, less vanity of exhibition of accomplishments &ndash; These two last circumstances w<sup>d</sup> cooperate &amp; change the habit prodigiously &ndash; It is true that the opinion of y<sup>e</sup> degeneracy ascends to Homer &amp; the bible  &ndash; still the generations really alter &ndash; but from what causes or in what precise respects are questions equally difficult &amp; curious &ndash; I am Sir yr obliged &amp; respectful sert</li>
