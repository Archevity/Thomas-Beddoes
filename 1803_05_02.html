	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Davies Giddy, 2 May 1803</h2>
	
	
<p>Dear Giddy</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I thought to reply to your last letter immediately &ndash; but something intervened; &amp; where a breach is once made between intention &amp; action it is apt to go on widening &ndash; I want particularly to know your principles for a school &amp; college &ndash; I suppose you  some knowledge of causes as ingredients of effective mortals &ndash; the term &amp; the idea ‘able-bodied’ is too much confined to seamen  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The present &lt;late&gt; epidemic, as far as far as I can conflate by the communications of medical men &amp; my own observation has immediately destroyed or rendered consumptive from 200 to 500 people   Now I believe I prevented it in all the families I saw by acid fumes &ndash; &amp; if I can render it tolerably probable as I &amp; most others, who looked sharp, believe, that it is contagious, I shall be able to persuade these who practice, when it appears next, to extinguish it at once &ndash; This is remote &ndash; but what can a medical man, or any man, do better? </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">By proposing these queries,  with the expressed condition of being allowed to publish them, to your medical neighbours any where at Penzance, Marazion &amp; c you w<sup>d</sup> oblige me &ndash; I have latterly added a query to induce practitioners to compare the exceptions in measles &amp;c &amp; in influenza &ndash; for the exceptions are the early cause of scepticism &ndash; that is, where one only in a family has the complaint &amp; there is no intended or casual separation  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The date is of great importance &ndash; for if you can disprove the operation of y<sup>e</sup> atmosphere, you do much towards establishing contagion &ndash; &amp; it is a certain fact that in all the variations of distinct temperature of the wind, the influenza has begun in one place or another. And it is hard to suppose a given quality of the air to persist under such variations &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I hear different chemists are at work to produce another revolution in chemistry &ndash; The great base of the great theory, the composition of water, seems improbable after the production of oxygen &amp; hydrogen in 2 masses f<sup>m</sup> water  &ndash; The defensive suppositions seem very forced &ndash; </p>

<p>T.B. </p>

<p>I wish you w<sup>d</sup> read Delphine  &ndash; When I am to tell a person what I think of the author’s power in rendering sentiments, I can hardly think of any comparison but Shakespeare &ndash; The richness of observation &amp; variety of character far exceeds any fiction of the sort that I know.  They say it is a bad book in its tendency &ndash; I cannot say that placing myself in the situation of a character to be formed, I am sensible of any bad impression from the whole of the book &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">My wife is writing to your sister  &ndash; You would guess that I write on this because I have no other copy of my queries  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">If you succeed in collecting any considerable quantity of matter, perhaps you c<sup>d</sup> send it some way through an MP    There is no one here at present   I think my wife for so near her time is pretty well </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Yr<sup>s</sup> always</p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes </p>

<p>PS. I nearly forgot to say that I am almost sure nitrous oxyd w<sup>d</sup> be a cordial beyond all cordials for your father &ndash; I have now two invalids who had been generally broken down, quite repaired by it &ndash; I have seen its renovating powers in extreme old age &ndash; You know there is no risque in a constitution &amp; at a time of life like your father’s  &ndash; The trouble of having is not, I resume, to be set in competition against any great accession of comfort &ndash; T.B. </p>

<p>1. Are you able to judge from your own observations whether the Influenza is contagious, or otherwise? </p>
<p>2. What was the nature of the observations that fixed your opinion? </p>
<p>3. On comparing a number of cases, do you think the influenza distinguishable from a common catarrh?  </p>
<p>4. In single instances, did not the symptoms so much resemble those of common catarrh as to render you doubtful whether they belonged to that or to the influenza? </p>
<p>5. On various occasions, was there not greater and more sudden depression than is almost ever seen in common catarrh; and did not the disorder appear, at various times, in almost all the gradations from pneumonia to low fever? </p>
<p>6.  On what day did you see the first case of well-marked influenza? &ndash; and on what day the last? </p>
