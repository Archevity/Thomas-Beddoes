	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, [24 October 1794] </h2>
	
<p>Dear Sir</p>	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I will send you 2 dozen of copies if I can get them to day or as soon as I can &ndash; for the stock of paper (which was very good) on which the engravings were taken off, was soon exhausted, &amp; we are obliged to wait for more 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Consumption must be curable if we can apply our power; but we shall hardly do this with<sup>t</sup> rooms filled with modified air &ndash; in other words, without a constant application of it &ndash; It evidently acts by promoting absorption, as appears not only from the dryness of the ulcer in Dr E’s  cases but by the dispersion of the hard lumps &ndash; hence I have hope it will disperse tubercles &ndash; fixed air,  I mean. I certainly will establish a pneumatic magazine or commentary; if the Pneumatic hospital succeeds &ndash; As for the hypercritic, it was only a sally  &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As soon as the smaller apparatus arrives, I will labour to investigate the cause of speedy death from hydrocarbonate.  If I cannot see any distinct appearances, then your opinion as expressed in your former letter, viz of its acting on the nerves must be adopted.  To which I have no objection but that it is an expression to which no ideas correspond, as all similar expressions respecting the phaenomena of health &amp; disease must be.   At the same time, I am aware this, though unsatisfactory, is better philosophy than assigning causes that do act in nature but not upon the particular occasion.  This investigation will furnish an article for such a periodical work as you suggest  &amp; I hope you will yet furnish me hints of conjectures if your health excludes you from ascertaining new facts. I wish you w<sup>d</sup> be so good as read Dr Darwin’s chapter on vertigo  &amp; combine <compare> his theory with your obs<sup>ns</sup> &amp; reflections.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Lord Daer bears fixed air astonishingly. He takes as 1 to 3½ atmospheric &ndash; with<sup>t</sup> the least titileation or disagreeable effect or feeling. I wish he was not going to Lisbon; for having brought him to this standard, I w<sup>d</sup> contrive to give him f. a. constantly. But he goes to certain death from a possibility of help. In the Nottingham hospital they have been using f. a. in psoas &amp; other fatal abscesses with perfect success. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Capper was many, many days in the way.  He declined very rapidly &ndash; certainly he did not decline much, while here: &amp; seemed rather gaining after his imprudence  &ndash; Whether these circumstances arose from any action of elastic fluids, time, the great unriddler of mysteries, must determine. I have been busy &amp; much indisposed &ndash; otherwise I w<sup>d</sup> have written to you sooner. I had a smart febrile attack, which affected my head much.  It is scarce clear yet or easy.  Y<sup>rs</sup> </p>

<p>T. Beddoes</p>

<p>I gave the printer a frank from L<sup>d</sup> Selkirk to inclose your engravings. He, I suppose, neglected the day &amp; had the modesty to pay carriage.   I did not know the circumstance but from your letter.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Do not you think Caoutchouc in linseed oil, or copal varnish  might be used instead of, or along with, linseed oil &amp; litharge? </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Have you brought your mind at all to bear on the problem I stated last &ndash;?  Perhaps if you contrive any apparatus, it will do equally to warm &amp; cool air &ndash; which last may have an useful application. </p>
