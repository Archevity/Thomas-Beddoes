	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Josiah Wedgwood, 19 June 1807</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-align: right;">19 June 1807</p>


<p>Dear Wedgwood </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I flatter myself I can give you satisfaction on every point in your letter  &ndash; Before I became unable to attend the Institution, above 10,000 patients had been registered, almost all with chronic complaints &amp; among them an unusual number of children &ndash; You may suppose we had multitudes of curved spines &amp; generally bones soft or ulcerated &ndash; not one I think whose parents were moderately attentive, with the degree of ailment you describe that did not do well &amp; to whom it was not an advantage to have had such a complaint to bring him under our cognizance &ndash; I can say as much of various patients of another class</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have seen many patients treated by the person you mentioned &amp; have examined some of the apparatuses &ndash; &amp; they were not exactly consumptive cases brought to me, as perhaps curable by no method &ndash; but I had opport<sup>y</sup> to make incidental observations &ndash; a daughter of Mr Anstes  of B Water had been long under treatment &ndash; I saw her from a chance call at her fathers &ndash; examined &amp; weighed the machine, ascertained that there had been no improvement &ndash;  &amp; her uncle, a surgeon &amp; accurate anatomist, thought her pelvis distorted since she had gone from him &ndash; I have seen others where there was good reason to suspect such mischief &ndash; I am sure that in no instance I saw, any surgeon &amp; perhaps any whitesmith but what might have done as well &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">To straighten the spine I prefer lying down first, then raising the trunk by degrees on a chair with a moveable back first as equally effectual, 2ndly as incapable of doing mischief to other parts, 3rdly as more merciful &ndash; Then as much attention sh<sup>d</sup> be paid to the constitution as to the weak part by giving the muriates steel  or what may best suit &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The cry of the public being so much in favour of a<del>ny</del> man, you will perceive that the cure of the most easy cases will be attributed to his method as a peculiar merit &ndash; I feel assured that in 3 or 4 cases I c<sup>d</sup> have done as much for the spine &amp; saved the patients from consumption into which they fell under him &amp; died after I think six months a very long time indeed for such a case as I apprehend yr<sup>s</sup> to be &ndash; I sh<sup>d</sup> imagine the treatment might be exceedingly relaxed in two &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">My wife is out &ndash; &amp; tolerable for her &ndash; The children pretty well &ndash; remember me to Jos &ndash; Davies Giddy goes tomorrow &ndash; not well at all</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I remain Dear Wedgwood<br>
	Yr<sup>s</sup> truly</p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>
