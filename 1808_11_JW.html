	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, November 1808</h2>
	
	
<p>Dear Sir, </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The poor brother of y<sup>r</sup> very sensible &amp; respectable agent died at last! When at Kineton, I left a paper signifying how desirable it w<sup>d</sup> be that his disorder should be ascertained.  His family consented; &amp; as I suspected at our short interview in summer, great dilapidation of the abdominal viscera was discovered. The most considerable part of these changes no doubt took place since that interview &amp; I suppose any person who had had sagacity to evacuate him freely, keep him low &amp; employ strong counterirritation might have restored so young a man to health &ndash;  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I begin with this subject because it is only today that I have got the acct. of the examination of the body &ndash; I wish to ask you a few questions, respecting the health of the poor &amp; the regimen of hard labourers in a high temperature &ndash; Before harvest last, a few observations of mine were circulated in newspapers concerning the bad effects of strong fermented liqours in harvest labourers; &amp; indeed going so far as to say that unfermented diluents are best to work upon.  The idea found great favour in many places &ndash; <em>among the masters</em>, mind &ndash; &amp; they were enlarged into a little tract of <cite>Good Advice</cite>  &ndash; This has induced persons to suggest to me to draw up a little body of instructions for the working class &ndash; I have endeavoured to get all the light I could; &amp; should be very glad of much more &ndash; Certain steady workmen employed many years in the hottest and hardest parts of the iron manufactories in S. Wales are clear that beer of the strength called <em>ale</em> is hurtful &amp; weakening &ndash; beer of the strength of 10 gallons of malt to 30 gallons not injurious &ndash; but from much experience they do not think it at all preferable to water &ndash; perhaps plain water is not so good as milk &amp; water &ndash; butter milk &amp; some Scotch &amp; Welsh liquors. Your observation can perhaps supply facts &ndash; It is obvious that men who have scarcely laboured hard without ale ought to have no vote &ndash; But if any are in <del>that</del> &lt;the&gt; works, who have conscientiously tried different drinks, their testimony w<sup>d</sup> be important &ndash; And if you can favour me with anything on which you can pretty well depend, or get anybody else to do [MS torn] should thank you much. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">There is another very important point, on which you can furnish instructions, if any body at all can &ndash; Among the hardships incident to married poor women, who have a family, I have noticed one as peculiarly severe &ndash; Nothing can support their health against it &ndash; &amp; in consequence of it, a very slight cold shall render them sickly for years &amp; at length destroy them. This is neither more nor less that their frequent dabbling in water to wash  &ndash; C<sup>d</sup> no good genius invent a machine, by which opulent neighbours attentive to the welfare of these hard fated human creatures, shall be able to redeem some of them from this destructive drudgery? —   </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">We have heard from time to time a favourable account of y<sup>r</sup> health &amp; that of Mrs Watt &amp; hope this tempestuous October may not have injured it in either &ndash; Here Mrs Beddoes has contrived to have another daughter  &ndash; 4 in all &ndash; 2 &amp; 2.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I hope Mr R. Boulton  is got about &ndash; something or other had pressed on Mr Murdoch’s  digestive organs. I sh<sup>d</sup> not be surprised to hear of his having gallstones &ndash; with united compliments to y<sup>r</sup> family / including Mr J<sup>s</sup> Watt,  my wife and I remain </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">with great regard yours</p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes </p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Mr Murdock mentioned to me the heat to which founders are exposed in y<sup>e</sup> casting of large cylinders &ndash; w<sup>d</sup> not putting on a wet shirt, just before going into the focus of the heat spare a man some suffering?  </p>
