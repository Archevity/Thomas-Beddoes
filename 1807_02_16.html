	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to T.G. Estcourt, 16 February 1807</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-align: right;">16 Feb. 1807</p>

<p>My dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have no idea that if you take the calomel pills 2 nights out of 3 till you have taken about 10 doses in all that the slightest harm can arise from your mode of life  &ndash; The warmbathing I hope you will have recourse to, as soon as you &lt;can&gt; make it convenient &ndash; The smallest suspicion of the increase of pain from cold spunging sh<sup>d</sup> insist you to desist till summer &ndash; I believe that after the calomel &amp; some continuance of warm bathing, some balsamic medicine w<sup>d</sup> be of great use &ndash; &amp; that was my reason for asking you to write me some acc<sup>t</sup> of yourself &ndash; Perhaps in a fortnight or thereabouts it may be proper to begin such a medicine &ndash; And if you have then time &amp; inclination to favour me with a short statement of the feelings about the chest, I c<sup>d</sup> send you a prescription &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Your brother’s symptoms were such that it w<sup>d</sup> have been rash to have trusted to their going off of themselves. But I trust with confidence that all mischief will be prevented. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">On the two other subjects of your letter, I am afraid it will not be easy to give you satisfaction &ndash; In the hooping cough, the essential thing is to ease the constitution by applications adapted to the particular state at the moment &ndash; If there be any signs of inflammation, to bleed in some way &ndash; if feverish heats, to take them off immediately &ndash; In general I think frequent use of vomits not beneficial in proportion to the severity of the practice &ndash; &amp; I dread the free use of such a narcotic as hemlock which I believe is much in fashion &ndash; especially as I know that the cough may be mitigated to any degree by gentler means &ndash; this a great object to prevent all bad consequences by change of air, &amp; by medicines, if necessary &ndash; as soon as ever I am able I shall draw up a small tract on this subject, but do not think I can say anything to y<sup>r</sup> purpose at this distance &amp; with<sup>t</sup> knowing the precise state of each little patient &ndash;</p>
	
 <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> As to education, I agree with you perfectly that one must be careful not to be misled by hypothesis &ndash; I have tried a deviation from the common plan only in 2 instances &ndash; &amp; I believe the boys turned out perfectly well grounded &ndash; They are at Eton &ndash; Mr Ralph Lambton can give you an acc<sup>t</sup> of them.  They were his two eldest nephews &ndash; You are aware of the importance that a knowledge of the useful arts is now gaining &ndash; It is well to have fashion at all on our side &ndash; And I doubt if it w<sup>d</sup> be accounted much of a singularity, if to the age of 12 or 13, boys were put to a master, who c<sup>d</sup> teach them science &amp; arts as well as classics &ndash; after that age, a large school w<sup>d</sup> be less dangerous inasmuch as their minds w<sup>d</sup> be already occupied &ndash; which w<sup>d</sup> be a great guard agt. temptation  &ndash; To find a master may be some but will not prove an insuperable difficulty &ndash; And I think there sh<sup>d</sup> be from 12 to 20 boys &ndash; in order to obviate the shyness &amp; other inconveniences resulting from absolutely private or domestic tuition &ndash;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> The subject, you see, is copious &amp; many explanations might be necessary &ndash; &amp; indeed it c<sup>d</sup> not well be discussed by letter &ndash;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> I am Dear Sir<br>
	with great respect<br>
	y<sup>r</sup> very ob<sup>t</sup> sert</p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>

<p>Please to let your servant put the enclosed  into some 2<sup>d</sup> p<sup>t</sup> office</p>

<p>P.S. Is it quite certain that the hooping cough is got among y<sup>r</sup> little people? &ndash;  I know only that the present epidemic has symptoms sometimes like the hg. Cough &ndash; Indeed y<sup>r</sup> brother hoops a little &ndash;  I w<sup>d</sup> not swear he has not got it &ndash;  but I by no means think so &ndash; </p>
