	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Davies Giddy, 29 October 1793</h2>
	
<p>Dear Giddy</p>	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The deficiency of such matter as w<sup>d</sup> furnish an agreeable subject of correspondence has been the principal cause of my backwardness in writing to you. I sent you sometime ago a printed sheet which, I dare say you have received, though it does not appear from your letter whether you have or not.   D<sup>r</sup> Withering has received your letter, so the delivery of your message was unnecessary. As your parcel had been detained so long, <del>they were</del> &lt;it was&gt; kept a little longer to add something else to <del>them</del> &lt;it&gt;. I hope to be able to send <del>them</del> &lt;it&gt; off soon. I do not know whether a refined air can be supplied sufficiently long to the lungs to cure consumption. In Crump’s case the father assures me that the colour of the blood was changed by the hydrogene air &lt;i.e. turned black&gt;.  If it can be effected the patient must have the air in his own room to breathe frequently, which may now easily be managed. That in some instances this disorder may be prevented I am quite sure &ndash; at least, the effects which I have beheld render this highly probable &ndash; the powers of oxygene air will be of much more extensive application. Spasmodic asthma I have cured by it, &amp; dyspnoeia arising from other causes &ndash; I see no reason either in theory or in practice to doubt the permanency of its effects. They at least may be kept up by repeated inhalation in which there can be nothing formidable either on acc<sup>t</sup> of expence, difficulty or unpleasantness.  But on this subject I must either be very concise or write very much at length. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">D<sup>r</sup> Darwin has in the press a work of the most astonishing ingenuity, & I believe I may add, truth.  It is a treatise on the laws of animal nature, which he has been the first to discover fully. It is, as to materials &amp; arrangement, perhaps the most original work ever composed by mortal man. I am persuaded that you by reading it will understand more of diseases than most professional people – indeed in a few year as soon as he information it contains becomes general, it must make a vast change in the practice of medicine. I think apothecaries will not be able to persuade patients to swallow their slops at their present rate &ndash; but the greatest good resulting from the book will be to enable those who understand it to form some judgement of the skill of physicians. John Hunter has had in the press a work on inflammation, from which much is to be expected.    </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Dr. Withering has mentioned to me a circumstance which adds considerable confirmation to my opinion, that excess of oxygene is a circumstance of importance in florid consumption &amp; before this disease takes place. He has known instances where vitriolic acid  has produced hæmoptoe.  If you will take down the name &amp; circumstances of the person whose case he mentioned to me, I sh<sup>d</sup> be obliged to you.  I called at the York Hotel  with this intention this morning, but having been detained by a patient I f<sup>d</sup> Dr W gone. The case I mean was where first infusum Rosæ  &amp; then vitriolic acid in larger doses by itself produced hæmoptoe. I have had an astonishing number of &lt;ordinary&gt; patients, since I came here; &amp; circumstances of a local nature seem likely at Bristol to prove favourable to me. I am become in some measure acquainted with the Clayfields. William Cl. is a very promising young man.  </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You do very right I think in investing property in America. It is impossible you sh<sup>d</sup> not wish your whole property there. I am persuaded especially from conversation with Dr Moise, the blind lecturer in philosophy,  that you w<sup>d</sup> find yourself more at home in Philadelphia than Tredrea. You might not only gain respect but money with your knowledge there. I know very well the impediments &amp; it is one instance more of the inconveniences attending the possession or expectation of property. &ndash;  The triumph of despotism seems at present scarce so sure as it lately did. But however one event is to be dreaded, the opposite, as things stand, can hardly be said to be desirable; the present generation in every country of Europe has much evil & very little good to look forwards to.  Guillemarde  is not arrived &ndash; I shall have to undertake a voyage but I know not exactly when,  as I have patients likely to detain me some weeks, if not months &ndash; My respects to all your family &ndash; I remain</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Yours with great regard</p>

<p>Tho<sup>s</sup> Beddoes</p>
