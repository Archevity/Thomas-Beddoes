	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wilkinson, 12 March 1801</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"></p> 
 <p style="text-align: right;">March 12  1801</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I kept an acc<sup>t</sup> of the £25 &amp; the £300 rec<sup>d</sup> from you &ndash; I believe you never told me before of their approbation &amp; I am much obliged by your instructions &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I enclose what I have purchased for John  &ndash; Some other things, as Stewarts Athens,  Antichta d’Ercolano  are ordered &ndash; I have not yet the acc<sup>t</sup> of them &ndash; They retain their value &amp; improve in value &ndash; If you, next settling, disapprove of these articles it will be no great evil for me to keep them &ndash; I think them most highly useful because they purify the taste by giving ideas of the antique &amp; shew by a glance what is &lt;often&gt; not well comprehended by a long definition &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">If you &amp; L<sup>y</sup> Anne &amp; Mr R. L.  have no objection the Voyages Picturesque,  my opinion is that they would give a great scope of ideas to the boys &ndash; but certainly I shall always defer most cheerfully to your authority where it does not sanction my ideas &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">My desire is that you should communicate the substance of what I said to L<sup>y</sup> Anne  &amp; Mr R, as far as you judged it useful &amp; advantageous &ndash; but where you thought I uttered nonsense to suppress it &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I beg to trouble you with one word more partly on the subject of my last letter  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I know not whether you will give me credit for firm attachment to the boys to their father’s memory &amp; to their guardians. You will certainly give me credit for speaking with some knowledge of their constitution of mind &amp; body.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Lady Anne seems more charmed than ever with their sense their manners &amp; their improvement as far as she can judge &ndash; She came at a fortunate time for convincing herself that what I am going to say is not chimerical &ndash; She must have perceived in William clear signs of a disposition to that disease which has done so much mischief in the family.   In John I have perceived vestiges though fainter of the same complaint &ndash; To you I need not observe that health is the prime consideration and I repeat it to you that in the year succeeding Sep<sup>r</sup> next, I have no doubt of being able to strengthen both their constitutions more than in the preceding  &ndash; I have had both both under a little course of medicine &amp; regimen &ndash; You know the younger children live in London, or are subjected to confinement, or exposed to the wear &amp; tear of a school, if their constitutions are weak, the more are they liable to have those constitutions injured &ndash; You know better than I do what harm will arise from being kept from Eton &ndash; Here they will improve, have air &amp; exercise, &amp; learn more of society &amp; human characters then (I believe) at any school &ndash; And if you think a year too long to be kept from Eton, there w<sup>d</sup> be &lt;an&gt; advantage in passing even the winter under my eye.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">L<sup>y</sup> A having been very unreserved, I have broke through my repugnance &amp; laid these considerations before her, wishing that she w<sup>d</sup> let the next boy  come as <em>visitor</em> (for I will have no compensation for him but the idea of serving the family) for 6 or 12 months &ndash; He w<sup>d</sup> become endeared to his brothers &amp; learn by their example, which I assure you has reclaimed one who was almost idiotic</p>
