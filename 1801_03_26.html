	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wilkinson, 26 March [1801]</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"></p> 
 <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Clifton 26 March
My dear Sir
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am much obliged to you for favouring me with your sentiments so much at large &ndash; &amp; the more so as you are not over-fond of letter-writing. In what you say, there is much force and truth. And it is impossible not to feel the justness of your observation respecting the effect of public schools in curing certain defects of character &ndash;You will do right in sending <em>both</em> boys to a public school &ndash; Set that point down as settled &ndash; But I w<sup>d</sup> intreat their guardian, in the name of the boys’ health &amp; happiness, to consider one question &ndash; <em>whether a year’s delay</em> can produce any disadvantage to be set in competition with <em>an improvement in their constitution</em>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It is yours to decide But w<sup>d</sup> you not blame me, if I do not represent all the facts which I deem of consequence? </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You speak of John.  I intended when he left Clifton, to [<del>xxxx</del>] put into your hands a paper, respecting him.  But the occasion calls; &amp; I will now lay before you the principal part of what I have to say. &ndash; I am sorry to be obliged to remind you of scenes, which you must wish may never occur again.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">John’s Grandmother was a victim to consumption, as I know from Dr Renaudet  who visited her as a physician abroad. I need not mention the inference from this fact &amp; from another, too recent in your memory. As every person whose parent has died of consumption is in some danger, the danger is much greater when the disease has appeared in the two last generations. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Now with regard to John, his conformation is more unfavourable than Betty’s.  His more rapid growth is somewhat against him. Lady Anne  will remember my expressing great anxiety about John.  In fact, he shewed all the signs that almost ever appear at his age of a consumptive disposition &ndash; There were frequent large &amp; spontaneous bleedings of the nose &amp; a swelling of the glands in his neck.  You have observed perhaps the length of his neck &amp; how his shoulder-blades stand off like wings. &ndash;
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Were Billy to be unfortunate in his health, he would suffer more like Miss Lambton  &ndash; but John w<sup>d</sup> follow the fate of his father.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The regimen &amp; course of medicine on which I put John &amp; on which I certainly think he ought to be put for some time occasionally, subdued these very unpromising appearances.  He was growing thin &amp; weak, but was happy enough to gain flesh. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Of Billy’s becoming a robust man, if he is properly managed I have not the smallest doubt. And if I c<sup>d</sup> obtain the inspection of John for a year &amp; half from this time, I c<sup>d</sup> do much to correct the disposition which I have described &amp; which I fear I also observe in Fanny. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It w<sup>d</sup> not surprise me if what I state makes little impression. I dare say there are few physicians in Europe who are more consulted personally &amp; by letter about consumption cases than myself. And I assure you the difficulty I often find in making the friends of young people careful is inconceivable to me, feeling as I do the extreme necessity of early preventive measures. Even when they have seen their relations perishing, they will not take warning.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">When John is growing up, I w<sup>d</sup> strongly recommend that he should be examined every half year by some person, who thoroughly understands &lt;this subject&gt; &ndash; Schoolmasters unluckily are the most ignorant people alive of what belongs to health. Consumption may be taking root &amp; a person who does not know how to look for its signs may suppose the party in florid health &ndash; I also hope you will not rely upon fashionable London physicians &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Lady A has very justly supposed that John’s disposition is extremely peculiar. In fact, he has the greatest sensibility I ever observed in any child; &amp; being, as I understand, harshly treated by a nurse, his character has received a strong impression from that circumstance &ndash; I believe he was never properly sullen &ndash; I think that a school w<sup>d</sup> not have been the proper place to correct this peculiarity. I am sure if from diffidence &amp; extreme desire of succeeding, he had failed in his first lessons, he w<sup>d</sup> have been rendered stupid and malicious. He w<sup>d</sup> have hated his learning &amp; tormented, as far as he c<sup>d</sup>, all who were subject to his power &ndash; But his disposition is now open &ndash; he was very tenderly treated &amp; made to feel his powers &ndash; It is astonishing what a happy effect his success in learning has had upon his temper &ndash; He used to tyrannize sadly over Billy, when vexed &ndash; now he generally treats him with great kindness &ndash; I doubt whether the fault of John’s disposition was one which <em>any school</em> was well calculated to remove.  I assure you I think he might have been made much worse. But as this is a point on which we have &lt;luckily&gt; had no experience, I do not pretend to be certain about it.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have now laid open to you a matter to which I have paid anxious attention. I leave it entirely to your discretion what use is to be made of the communication. Shew it to Lady Anne, or tell her the substance in your own words. Some things may require to be softened, lest she should be too much alarmed &ndash; At the same time if she has any confidence in my opinion that we ought to be on our guard  (&amp; here facts speak for themselves) I hope she will believe me when I say that whatever evil exists may certainly be removed &amp; its progress prevented.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You speak obligingly of our care of these very fine children. My regard to their father’s memory, the happy disposition of the boys themselves &amp; their guardians’ concurrence in every measure proposed w<sup>d</sup> have rendered neglect unpardonable &ndash; You know that Mr Lambton  &amp; myself conversed much about early education.  He equally approved my ideas &amp; was averse to the prevailing practice. If you desire his opinion on the question which I have taken the liberty of proposing to your consideration, I most distinctly remember his expressing the strongest determination not to let his boys go early to a public school &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am sorry to trouble you so much at length &ndash; But the importance of the subject will, I trust, be a sufficient excuse &ndash;</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I am, my dear Sir<br>
	Yr<sup>s</sup> most truly</p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>

<p>I hope when you come hither, you will make my house your home</p>
