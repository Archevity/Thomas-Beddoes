	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, 18 January 1797 </h2>
	
	
 
 <p>Dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have a letter by me for you written in the first enthusiasm of my satisfaction at the great cure of Mr H (Hawkins) by nitric acid  &ndash; but I did not send it from ignorance of your station. The first copy of the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> parts I too had from a Bristol Bookseller for Johnson, whose hurry of business I suppose puts him above small attentions, sent me no copy till some time after the pamphlet was ready  &ndash; I expected you w<sup>d</sup> find fault with part of the anticriticism;  but I thought you w<sup>d</sup> allow the falsehood respecting Alford to be rectified.  &ndash; I still suppose you will <warmly> disapprove of what I have said on Dr J. C. Smyth.   Dr Trotter I see in his just published Med Nautica has handled him more severely  &ndash; But I suppose Dr Trotter is wrong as to want of power in acid vapours to destroy contagion  &ndash; The facts I have to state are as follow &ndash; In Lues V. the nitric acid has answered in another <i>secondary</i> case &amp; Dr Darwin says it has in one with him &amp; in 2 asthmas from liver disease  &ndash; In one case of liver &amp; stomach complaint I am now giving it with great apparent advantage &ndash; &amp; in another I have begun to use it; &amp; in one asthmatic case where air did no good or harm, the patient thinks this acid has afforded greater relief than all among 100 previous medicants &ndash; &amp; the case is in progress &ndash; It has much amended the appetite in all the cases &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Mrs Lippincote’s is a melancholy narrative &ndash; I tried carbonic ac. &amp; hydrocarb. gasses &amp; no effect good or bad followed.  The surgeon, author of the improvement of the treatment of sore legs,  took her in hand, at my request.  The first application produced the greatest amendment I ever beheld; but it did not continue; the ulcer returned to its foul condition.   She was however better &ndash; &amp; her constitution improved &ndash; After living near the surgeon some weeks or months her friends, I am told, insisted on her return into Devonshire &ndash; She, though worth 10,000£, was weak enough to comply &ndash; In the country the wound got into its old condition &amp; wore her out &ndash; She had by her a letter written to the surgeon to renew the treatment &ndash; but had not fortitude to send it &ndash; His book is in the press &amp; will contain her case   I will immediately send it you. I have the pleasure to inclose &lt;notes of&gt; an important case  &ndash; A second, as Dr Rollo  tells me, has been successfully treated &ndash; the urine in 3 days was reduced from 12pt to 2½ &ndash; I have written to Sir G. Staunton an acct of poor Dr Gillan who is, I fear, almost dead of diabetes. I talked with Dr Ingenhousz about tar in ether, but I am using tar in smoke from coal &ndash; with what event you shall hear soon. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I thought to close the particular series of the pamphlets; &amp; to alter the title &amp; the plan  &ndash; Dr T.  is I believe a humane &amp; veracious man, but he is a sad medical reporter &ndash; &amp; I wish not to be the editor of more such cases as several he has sent me &ndash; I w<sup>d</sup> publish such only as are well-authenticated in the issue &amp; well observed in the progress &ndash; for we may, I think, consider what has appeared as enough for caution &amp; for giving an idea how to begin &ndash; But I have no idea of further delay in the pneumatic Inst<sup>n</sup> &ndash; We have as many problems now before us requiring strict solution as will occupy much attention &amp; start others of equal importance &ndash; I have therefore begun a reasoned notification of my design &ndash; I wish I c<sup>d</sup> stay with you a week &ndash; I sh<sup>d</sup> gain much information advantageous to the design. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I must have somebody to assist, who has the genius of experiment  &ndash; I c<sup>d</sup> not go to see my relations in Shropshire. I have had variety of common inflammatory complaints to occupy the day &ndash; I have not had many pneumatic cases; &amp; those mostly of phthisis in the last stage &ndash; I beg to be kindly remembered to Mrs Watt &amp; Mr James  &amp; am yours most truly</p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes </p>

<p>P.S. I talked with Dr Ewart &amp; I believe with others of applying oxygene &amp; oxyg<sup>d</sup> muriatic gas to poor Mrs Lippincote’s wound &ndash; Is it possible it w<sup>d</sup> have saved her?   From the accompanying pamphlet  it w<sup>d</sup> seem so &ndash;</p>
