	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to the Editor of <cite>The Monthly Magazine</cite>, 17 March 1803</h2>
	
	

<p>Sir,
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Your Magazine may yet reach many places before the influenza; and there are two or three remarks, which may be of use to persons disposed to neglect the complaint, or to treat themselves.  </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Supposing the influenza contagious at all, of which there seems to be no room to doubt, it would, at first sight, appear the most contagious of all diseases.   It certainly seizes more individuals than any other.   But one principal reason I take to be this: no pains are taken to guard against infection.  Those who are not confined by the severity of the attack, mix in society; and the different individuals of a family associate without precautions.  In other instances, the nature of the disorder keeps them apart, or precautions are taken in favour of the uninfected. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The influenza may be despised by the robust; but it is formidable enough to the puny and the infirm.  When it does not immediately destroy, it may leave behind it fatal consequences. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">There will, I believe, be no difficulty in securing many of those who are in most danger from its attacks.  In the first place, all communication should be cut off between these and the infected; every thing used or worn by the latter immediately put into water, and all the rules for preventing febrile infection regularly practiced. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Fumigation with mineral acids will probably add farther security.  I have been much surprised, at finding the accounts from Paris and London so silent upon this article; especially as our parliamentary debate,  the writings of M. Morveau  and Dr Odier,  and other eminent men, and the returns of the physicians deputed to the places visited by the Spanish epidemic, have of late so forcibly drawn the attention of all Europe towards this mode of prevention.  From the evidence it results that various species of contagion have been destroyed, in different countries and situations, by acid fumes.  They have, in truth, succeeded wherever they have been employed. Some particular facts must, I think, convince the most sceptical of their efficacy. Thus in the report concerning the terrible malady that ravaged Andalusia, Dr Cabanellas states, that in one quarter of Seville, he ordered the fumigation in seventy-seven houses at once; that immediately the number of infected diminished, and in a few days the contagion was totally extinguished.  To have complete personal proof of the power of acid fumes, he took the great coat, in which another physician, (Dr Sarrais ) had wrapped himself on his attack by the fever, and in which he had died.  He fumigated it twice, with burning sulphur, and then with nitrous acid fumes.  He spread it on his bed, and lay all night upon it.  It remained in contact with his skin till 8 o’clock, A.M.  He wore it all the morning, and then gave it to a beggar. No infection followed in either case.  </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Nothing can be more obvious, that to infer the same acid fumes <em>may</em> destroy the contagion of the influenza.  At present, we have only analogy in their behalf.  For although I have fumigated every house where I have found the reigning complaint and have not seen any infection afterwards, I have not experience enough to decide the question. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The trial is perfectly free from inconvenience and difficulty. It is only necessary to put an ounce of two of oil of vitriol  in a tea-cup or a saucer, and add a tea-spoon of salt-petre  from time to time.  White fumes will arise,  and these should be just sensible to the sight and smell, in which state almost every body finds them agreeable. No heat or apparatus is required. A tea-cup, so charged, may stand in each passage, and in the apartment of the uninfected. I suspected at first that the fumes might increase the cough proper to the complaint.  But I have not yet observed this. However, should there be any suspicion in individual cases, the fumes need not be extricated where the sick are. I have particularly interested in preserving some consumptive patients from the influenza; and they have not found the fumes offensive, when only just perceptible</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The danger of the hot regimen should be pointed out to those who may be inclined to treat themselves.  Heated apartments, warm, and especially spirituous liquids, a load of bed clothes, and close apartments, will often convert a slight into a dangerous, a dangerous into a fatal, attack.   Children and weakly young people will be debilitated into king’s evil  or consumption. Cold air, cool liquids, and the cool regimen, in general, should be perseveringly adhered to when the cough is tight, the skin hot, and generally during the first days. I add these remarks only for the sake of preserving those who act for themselves from error.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am Sir, your obedient Servant</p>
