<p>All of the material created by the <cite>Collected Letters of Thomas Beddoes</cite> project and provided on these pages is in copyright; here is how you can use it in your work, whether in print or online.</p>

<h2>Short Quotations</h2>
<p>If you want to use short (under 400 words) quotations in academic work, you can usually do so without further formal permission (for a note on Fair Dealing, see below). When you are citing, please include the following information.</p>
<p><b>Names of author(s) or editor(s)</b></p>
<ul><li>	If citing from the main introduction, the introductions to the sample Thomas Beddoes letters, or the introduction to <cite>The Love Letters and Love Poems of Anna Beddoes, Humphry Davy, and Davies Giddy</cite>, the author is Tim Fulford.</li>
<li>	If citing from the texts of the sample letters of Thomas Beddoes on this site, the editor is Tim Fulford.</li>
<li>	If citing from the edition of <cite>The Love Letters and Love Poems of Anna Beddoes, Humphry Davy, and Davies Giddy</cite>, the editors are Tim Fulford, Sara Slinn and John Beddoes.</li></ul>
<p><b>Name of the website and url</b></p>

<li>If you are referring only to the material relating to Thomas Beddoes and his letters, use the title “The Collected Letters of Thomas Beddoes”, along with the url ( the web address beginning https://). If referring to individual letters, include the names of the correspondents and the date of the letter. Note, however, that the texts of Thomas Beddoes’s letters appearing on this site are being published in print form with full editorial apparatus. Once the print edition is published, use that to reference these letters.</li>
<li>If you are only referring to the material relating to Anna Beddoes’s poems and poetry, use the title “The Love Letters of Anna Beddoes, Humphry Davy, and Davies Giddy, 1799-1809”, along with the url (the web address beginning https://). In addition, if referring to particular letters, include the names of the correspondents and the date of the letter, e.g. Anna Beddoes to Davies Giddy, 10 May 1802.</li>

<h2>How to format your citations.</h2>
<p>For guidance on how to present and format citations refer to the style guide provided by your university, publisher or content host. We cannot advise you on this.</p>
	<hr style="width:50%; height:1px; background:#6D95A7; background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #ccc, #6D95A7, #ccc);">

<h2>Fair Dealing</h2>
<p>Fair dealing is legal exemption which allows the use of short quotations without permission from the copyright owner. It applies only to quotation used within works of criticism (eg. in academic work or critical journalism) . Fair Dealing does not apply to any commercial use such as slogans, advertising or commercial publication, nor does it apply to reuse of prose or text for epigrams in books, or in publications for entertainment.</p>
<p>Fair dealing is not defined specifically by the law, but is tested in court. For general guidance you can cite up to 400 words in a single extract or 800 words split over several extracts. Note, however, that Fair Dealing does not allow for the reproduction of more than about twenty five per cent of a poem, however short a poem it is. </p>
<p>Publishers have varying definitions of Fair Dealing, so you are advised to ask your publisher if they require formal permission from the copyright owner.</p>
<p>This project is keen to encourage the use of our material, so please get in touch if you think your plans fall outside the Fair Dealing provisions.</p>

<h2>What if I want to use longer quotations or a whole poem? Or what if I want to use a quotation from this material in a commercial or non-critical context, e.g. on a t-shirt, mug, on a website of favourite poems, etc.</h2>

<p>We are delighted that you would like to reuse this material  but please do not do so without first contacting us and obtaining necessary permissions.  <a href="mailto:tfulford@dmu.ac.uk"> tfulford@dmu.ac.uk</a></p>

<h2>Sometimes it is easier just to link to the original source.</h2>
<p>If you want to reproduce a significant amount of text online, sometime it is simplest, and gives greatest intellectual transparency, to use a hyperlink that will guide your readers to the text in its original context, rather than copying it out on your own site. This helps readers avoid confusion about who the authors and copyright owners are.</p>
