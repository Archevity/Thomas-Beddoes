	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Davies Giddy, 7 April 1793</h2>
	
	
<p>Oxford Sunday 7 April 1793 - direct to No l1 Hope Square Bristol Hotwells 
if you write in a month – if not, you shall hear from me again – </p>

<p>Dear Giddy	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You will no doubt have wondered at my apparent neglect in so long delaying an answer to your last letter; it is even very possible that you may have written another & I not have received it.  The last which came to my hands was dated during your expedition ag<sup>t</sup> the rioters.  – I for my own part am about to take a long farewell of this seat of the Muses. Last summer I had given the V Chan<sup>r</sup> notice that I sh<sup>d</sup> resign after one other course of lectures, which I felt considerable reluctance at the thought of reading. My political sentiments &amp; the manner in which I expressed them  saved me from all embarrassment. Adams some months ago informed me that I sh<sup>d</sup> have no hearers & that probably I sh<sup>d</sup> feel my residence here very uncomfortable.  He suggested a wish that I sh<sup>d</sup> then resign as he had some reason to believe that Stacy w<sup>d</sup> be appointed.  I immediately wrote to the V. Chanc<sup>r</sup>  signifying my intention to follow Adams’ advice &amp; desiring him to fix on a successor, at the same time adding that it w<sup>d</sup> be extremely inconvenient to me to give up the C lab<sup>y</sup> at that moment. Dr Bourne was appointed,  &amp; I am now going through the tedious process of packing up some of my things &amp; transferring the rest to him. I own to you that I expected find strong marks of aversion in the &lt;looks &amp;&gt; conduct of the clergy here. I was anxious that I had no title to their kindness – Except however in Smith,  who w<sup>d</sup> scarce speak to me, I have remarked an unusual forwardness of civility in the rest of my acquaintances. It can be no wonder that men’s exterior sh<sup>d</sup> become more smooth as their alarms subside; yet it feels to me as a mark of the increased liberality of the age. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I was in London lately but did not see J. Hawkins  I met with an old Scotch acquaintance with whom he was treating to accompany him in his oriental tour: he cd not have found in the three kingdoms a young man better qualified for the expedition.  When Hawkins &amp; he had almost agreed upon terms, Sibthorpe arrived &amp; insisted that Leslie sh<sup>d</sup> not accompany them to the tops of the hills nor publish any obs<sup>ns</sup> of his own – Leslie not being in a situation absolutely dependant rejected the proposal with disdain; &amp; so they parted.  The public has certainly in consequence been deprived of much information – </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I took up early an unfavourable opinion of the late French Convention. In all great emergencies they seemed to me to act with extravagant folly; it appeared as if they thought that they c<sup>d</sup> subdue the earth by decrees of fraternization; hence they utterly neglected the recruiting of their armies, &amp; instead of making a bulwark of the Belgians by conciliating their minds, they have managed so that the return of their old oppressors is felt as a deliverance. And so the farce is over – I am impatient to understand, better than the present acc<sup>ts</sup> enable me to do, the part played by the principal actor, Dumouriez  – Henceforward I shall perforce hold it vain to reflect upon the civil &amp; political relations among men; & not an old woman of either sex whom I shall not readily allow to be a greater proficient in this science than your friend </p>
