	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wilkinson, 17 April 1801</h2>
	
</p> 
 
<p style="text-align: right;">17 April &ndash;</p>

<p>Dear Sir
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">My chief communication at Lambton  was with you. There you expressly told me <em>that at any moment I might command accruing moneys</em>. Hence it was natural for me to conclude that I was to transact with you on acc<sup>t</sup> of the boys residence with me &ndash; This is the simple explanation of what appears obscure to you in my last letter  &ndash; &amp; I sh<sup>d</sup> think you might have deduced it from a previous letter of mine in which I request you to divide your remittance to me into smaller portions, which I sh<sup>d</sup> not have done, had I not imagined y<sup>t</sup> the whole sum &lt;to come from you&gt; w<sup>d</sup> be large &ndash; L<sup>y</sup> Anne  now informs me that she mentioned the arrangement to me &ndash; Therefore I doubt not but she did &ndash; However I have no recollection of any such thing &ndash; Of the remittances from her ladyship not one was ever referred to any particular object &ndash; &amp; altogether they do not amount to what I have advanced on the joint acc<sup>t</sup> &ndash; Now I understand the affair, <em>I</em> at least am satisfied,  it being indifferent to me with whom I settle &ndash; Unluckily we all omitted to make a memorandum at first &ndash; Ten lines w<sup>d</sup> have saved misapprehensions &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">That the £325 must be deducted is a thing that speaks for itself &ndash; I am as great a friend as any one can be to that accuracy to properly resolve to observe &ndash;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Upon Dr. Darwin’s decision  I calculate thus &ndash; From Saturday morning the day I set out from Clifton to the next Sat. morning when you obligingly went with us to Newcastle are just seven days &ndash; I reckon three &amp; a half for return &ndash; travelling expenses as in 1798 I take at eighteen pence a mile &ndash; all included &ndash; I mean this to be rather below the mark &ndash; The distance I make 287 miles &ndash; that multiplied by three gives £43..1..0 &ndash; If you have any objection to this computation, you will of course be so good as point it out &ndash;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">To prevent further differences of conception &amp; the disagreeable trouble of explanations, allow me to state that by L<sup>y</sup> Anne’s &amp; Mr R.L’s  express approbation the <em>Voy. pitteresques</em> are lately procured for John  &ndash; About this splendid &amp; expensive work I did not trouble you with a specific application because I had already your sanction for useful purchases &ndash;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I observe also that since the acc<sup>t</sup> was transmitted to you, other bills or articles for John separately have come in &ndash; However I have been carefully  to procure almost solely articles that are imperishable &amp; of improving value. Though I &lt;do not doubt, when property &amp; the advantage of a boy in John’s circumstances come in competition which sh<sup>d</sup> be sacrificed &amp; you seem of the same mind, I have always had the sacred regard to procuring a solid &amp; adequate consideration &ndash;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It is in this particular that I think John will feel &amp; find his infinite obligations to his guardians &ndash; Narrowness (or niggardliness rather) in the education of children destined to great fortune is almost universal &ndash; The <em>property</em> is regarded as the principal; the <em>person</em> as the accessory &ndash; Hence the frequent wretched fate of country gentleman &ndash; who either perish prematurely &ndash; &lt;or&gt; are tortured all their lives by the consequences of intemperance &ndash; or by the pains &amp; penalties of idleness &ndash; all which evils most schools promote. I am persuaded had Mr. Lambton’s mind been as early awakened as the minds of these boys, y<sup>t</sup> he w<sup>d</sup> now have been alive &lt;&amp;&gt; occupied about those useful objects which he latterly meditated &ndash; He used to impute the first blow to his constitution to school &amp; college temptations &ndash;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Billy  is a most uncommon boy. But John  I think exceeds any child I ever saw in industry, intelligence &amp; active curiosity &ndash; Had he gone to school &amp; been <em>cowed</em> at first, as from his shyness he &lt;easily&gt; might his understanding &amp; character w<sup>d</sup> both have been ruined &ndash; And still he may be injured, unless he is peculiarly managed at first going to school &ndash; Respecting his constitution I explained fully the nature of that to Mr Ralph, who mentioned it to me – You will probably learn more from Mr R. what I said &amp; I will spare you the repetition of remarks which evidently shew that from conformation &amp; positive symptoms he is disposed to the malady of his father &amp; grandmother  &ndash; If he escape this, he will make a very healthy man &ndash;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I thank you for saying you will let me know when you have decided &ndash; in one case the sooner I know the better &lt;for J &amp; B&gt; &ndash; There are certain past &amp; present ties which will never lose their influence on my mind &ndash; These make me very ardently wish the good of these children &ndash; Beyond these I have no motive beyond what you or the most independent person possible &lt;might have&gt;, either in considering what may serve them or in communicating my ideas to their guardians – I would not have submitted to this attention but from regard to their father, esteem for their friends &amp; kindness to the children &ndash; Not only have I laid out from £300 to £400 (in an elaboratory, a workshop, &amp;c &amp;c) for their sake &ndash; of which expenditure you will hear no more &ndash; but for 12 months I have &ndash; otherwise ag<sup>t</sup> my feelings &ndash; rec<sup>d</sup> a bigger boy &ndash; &amp; L<sup>y</sup> Anne thinks they have been better for his society &ndash; which was just what I intended &ndash;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I think now I have troubled you at suff<sup>t</sup> length &amp; with compt<sup>s</sup> to Mrs Wilkinson</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Am <br>
Yr<sup>s</sup> Sincerely </p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>
