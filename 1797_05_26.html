	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, 26 May 1797 </h2>
	
	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
 <p>Dear Sir</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I received your two letters &amp; am much obliged by your acct of poor [Beddoes leaves a blank space here].  I shall insert an abstract of your information that the public may know all we do on the subject  &ndash; After much much  enquiry I am likely to meet with an excellently qualified superintendant of a pneumatic Inst<sup>n</sup>   Before I engaged him provided the subscribers allow me to use my discretion, I should much like that you should see him &ndash; You never mentioned what you thought he should have <i>per ann. </i>  Mr Hare’s great subscribers &ndash;whose contributions make about £500 &ndash; are not quite satisfied that the Inst. is not likely to be in London.  At the same time they wish I should have the inspection of it &ndash; Thomas Wedgwood of whose additional £500 you have no doubt heard,  is likely to be here soon  &amp; I hope we may then get something forward.</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">To day I received the inclosed &amp; another letter in confirmation respecting the same patient.  This is one of the cases which seem to shew the propriety of always trying airs in our present method, till a better is devised.  Whatever the disease was it seems clearly of the most alarming kind &amp; as clearly benefited by hydrogen &ndash; Please return the letter at your convenience &ndash; I have had a certain acct. from Paris brought by a Bristol Merchant  lately arrived from thence that Fourcroy Morveau &amp;c are very much interested by what we have attempted hereon the subject &amp; are likely to prosecute it  &ndash; Is it not extraordinary that they did not know a word of the matter till Gimbernat  who went from England told them though the German journals have been full of this business  &amp; more than one translation has been published of the <i>Considerations</i> in German. </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I wish you would give my comp<sup>ts</sup> to Dr Withering &amp; tell him that I cannot allow Dr M&ndash; &ndash; &ndash;ffe  to be the most fashionable Doctor here &ndash; The fashion of a physician is to be determined by the quality multiplied into the no. of great patients &ndash; Now from the Royal Family downwards a greater number of great invalids have consulted me here than any other  Dr And they have come to the person not to the place &ndash; Now having troubled you with this weighty commission may I add another &ndash; viz that your clerk would draw on me for all except the larger-sized apparatus, which has not yet gone off &ndash; all I have had for myself or on your acc<sup>t</sup> &amp; Mr Boulton’s &ndash; I cannot well get bills on London &ndash; The dr<sup>t</sup> may be on sight  &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I also wish for a dozen mouth-pieces to be directed to Cottle’s bookseller Bristol  &ndash;</p> 

	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I expect soon a cargo of German medical books &ndash; &amp; suppose they will contain facts relative to airs &ndash; If so, I will let you know &ndash;  you said, in one of your letters that we should by right have a change of ministry  &ndash; I think so too &ndash; but I rather think the ministry will rather hazard any other change than indulge us in this &ndash; I am sure we cannot <i>stare loco</i> &ndash; Nor do I think Mr P will fully accomplish what he intends, if he means to put liberty under his feet rather than resign his misused powers   &ndash; The current year will give us more accurate ideas on these great subjects &ndash; meanwhile sincerely wishing you may escape the ruder tossings of the political chaos I remain yours most truly</p>
