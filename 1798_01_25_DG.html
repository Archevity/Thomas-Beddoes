	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Davies Giddy, 25 January 1798</h2>
	

 <p>Dear Giddy</p> 
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I know not if you have heard from her father the subsequent history of poor Miss Baines  &ndash; By the use of an inhaling mixture of aether &amp; some other ingredients (which last did so far excellent service) her symptoms became wonderfully mitigated.  At this moment a respectable family, having a vessel to themselves, are about to sail to Madeira &amp; I procured Miss B. leave to accompany them &ndash; She however resisted all my persuasions &ndash; though I imagine the expedition w<sup>d</sup> have put her fairly on her legs &ndash; I suppose this connected some disagreeable feelings with me in her mind &ndash; she dismissed me &ndash; 2 or 3 days &lt;ago&gt; I was recalled &ndash; I find her much worse &ndash; The hectic is formed &ndash; she has profuse sweats &ndash; &amp; much more expect<sup>n</sup> &ndash; I left her without any bad symptom whatever except a very trifling expectoration of a bad quality &ndash; The inhalation has saved her much suffering &ndash; The certainty with which it removes pain in the chest in this case is admirable. My next proposal is to imitate the exhalations from a cow-house Some cases I have had &amp; the effects of the medicated aether are very encouraging &ndash; But a childish scrupulosity, which I have never seen surpassed, will I fear be an effectual bar to the execution of the project &amp; I foresee we shall part &ndash; she disgusted with me &amp; I pitying the spoiled child  &ndash; You will not tell <i>all</i> this to any body but your mother  &ndash; The part you may tell any body I need not point out &ndash;</p> 
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You can imagine nothing beyond the consternation at Birm<sup>m</sup> during the alarm respecting Hamburgh, as I have it from James Watt Jun<sup>r</sup>  &ndash; The sensation generally felt in this country will induce the Directory  to execute the thing, if they had not resolved upon it before &ndash; &amp; if they be not intent on attacking us in points supposed by them more vulnerable &amp; more mortal &ndash;</p> 
		<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I hoped to see Dick Edwards  as Mrs Kivell  said he was coming &ndash; I sh<sup>d</sup> have requested him to furnish me with specimens from the copper furnaces, as he did once before  &ndash; Will you be so good as to ask him &ndash; If I receive them in March it will be time enough, though I care not how soon &ndash; They are for the chemical lectures  &ndash; If he does not keep his process with pseudogalina a secret, I sh<sup>d</sup> be glad of any specimens belonging to it &ndash; If any thing worth shewing lies within your reach, please to add it. &ndash; I shall have two good operators  &ndash; &amp; I trust they will get up an infinity of experiments &ndash; You w<sup>d</sup> have been pleased to see the select anatomical lectures for women go off so well &ndash; Nothing c<sup>d</sup> be better adapted &amp; I dare say several of the audience learned to spare their children some suffering. There were 36 subscribers but generally 50 women present.  &ndash; I rec<sup>d</sup> your fathers parcel &amp; ½ guinea   The occasional necessity of excitement to his hearing is curious &ndash; but why does not he use aether &amp; oil &ndash; see Zoonomia  &ndash; My wife had one of those &lt;late&gt; bad colds &ndash; was confined 5 days to bed &ndash; Some cough remaining, I sent her to Mr Keir’s  where she now is she has 50 times resolved to write to Miss Giddy  &amp; 100 times regretted not having written &ndash;  I have sometimes sinned ag<sup>t</sup> my conscience in this way myself </p> 
   	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I am dear Giddy <br> 
	Yr<sup>s</sup> truly </p> 

<p>T.B. </p>
