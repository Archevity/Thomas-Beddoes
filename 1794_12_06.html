	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wedgwood, 6 December 1794</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-align: right;">Clifton 6 Dec<sup>r</sup> 1794</p> 
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I received both your late letters in due time; &amp; hope no consideration will prevent you from writing to me as often as you have leisure &amp; inclination. I shall easily find time to answer, when that is necessary. I had conceived a new proposal very nearly on the plan you describe. The Watts agreed with me in thinking it eligible to wait 1. for the meeting of Parliament  &amp; 2. for some more scientific names, though the list is now both numerous &amp; respectable &ndash; The Dss of Devonshire had promised to apply last week to Sir J. Banks &amp; Mr. Cavendish.  Sir Ch. Blagdon had expressed himself strongly in favour of the practice last year.  But she has not written, as she gave me reason to expect  &ndash; &amp; I suppose the trials have engaged almost every person’s whole attention in London.</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">At Chester I have no correspondent. I believe I sh<sup>d</sup> have applied to Dr Haygarth,  but was told the Chester faculty had expressed great contempt of the whole design. I know not whether Dr H. was included in this expression. But if you can procure the insertion of an advertisement &amp; a few names by way of sanction &amp; example it w<sup>d</sup> be well to take the chance of that district.  I have inserted your hint, respecting the diseases of animals, in the Worcester paper.  I think the thought a very happy one &ndash; I had lately a consultation with Dr Hobbes of Monmouth,  who informs me Mr Green  has been very active &amp; successful &ndash; The [<s>xxxx</s>] design had found more favour with medical men than I expected &ndash; At Yarmouth I have applied to Dr Girdlestone, who is very well disposed to the scheme.  At York to Dr Hunter, but I know not whether he had moved   &ndash; At Norwich to Dr Lubbock, presuming on his genius &amp; knowledge but I know not the result  &ndash; At Exeter to Dr Daniel  who exerted himself &ndash; A very good &amp; intelligent person has taken up the cause there also &ndash; Rev J. Acland of Broadclist  &ndash; At <i>Shrewsbury</i>, Gloucester, Edinburgh, <i>Glasgow</i>, <i>Birmingham</i>, Oxford, <i>Bury St Edmunds</i>, Cambridge, Southampton, <i>Derby</i>, <i>Manchester</i>, <i>Liverpool</i>, Hull, Sherborne, &amp; in Cornwall the business has agents; &amp; good <or tolerable> ones in the places under-scored.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I submit to your correction the adv<sup>t</sup> on the opposite page for Chester &ndash; Can you procure Wheeler’s Manchester papers for November? &ndash; you will see how successful they have been in cancer &amp; other ulcers in the Infirmary there. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">If you choose to draw out an hand-bill from the proposal &amp; the adv<sup>t</sup> together, it w<sup>d</sup> in the meantime supply the place of a more extensive proposal &ndash; you might refer to the Reports of y<sup>e</sup> Manchester infirmary, to the Rev. J. Townsend’s <i>Guide to health</i> for the case of F. Page Esq MP for Oxford, of Mr Russel Engraver London &amp; some others,  as well as to Ewart’s pamphlet  &amp; mine  &ndash; </p>

 <br>
<p style="text-align: center;">Medical Pneumatic Institution</p>
<p>From various trials of <i>factitious airs</i> in the Bath and Manchester hospitals, as well as in private practice by Dr Ewart, Bath, Dr Thornton,  Mr Wathen  &amp; Mr Hill  surgeons in London &amp; Dr Beddoes, Bristol, there is good reason to believe that they will prove efficacious in many disorders hitherto found incurable: particularly in cancer, malignant ulcers, consumption &amp; palsy.  Experiments upon animals in a state of health corroborate these facts &amp; suggest the application of the &lt;same&gt; practice to the distemper in dogs &amp; the <i>murrain</i> in cattle. In order to discover the best mode of &lt;procuring&gt; &amp; applying these substances, many eminent philosophers &amp; physicians have approved of the formation of a <i>temporary</i> Institution: in which rooms may be filled with air properly modified, as will probably be necessary to a compleat trial of the practice in some diseases. Such an Institution w<sup>d</sup> also afford an opportunity of attempting the cure of various fatal disorders of animals in a manner that w<sup>d</sup> leave no doubt as to the result; at the same time, experimental investigation of longer continuance &amp; greater extent than have ever yet been [<s>xxxx</s>] [<s>xxxx</s>] &lt;devised&gt; might be carried on for the purpose of useful discoveries, applicable to the practice of physic.  These, it is to be understood, w<sup>d</sup> have healthy animals for their subjects. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">According to the testimonies above quoted, unexpected success has attended many of the imperfect trials hitherto made in this way; &amp; every case where &lt;the treatment&gt; has been employed, has contributed to shew that it is perfectly safe; it is moreover capable of almost endless variation &amp; improvement; nor can it be doubted that when men of genius perceive that their suggestions will be realised, they will exert their inventive powers in behalf of humanity. &ndash; The Institution, being designed for the universal benefit of mankind, will be carried on with the greatest openness possible, &amp; authentic accounts of its progress will be regularly published &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As there is scarce an individual who has not seen [<s>xxxx</s>] a relation or friend either tortured or prematurely destroyed by some disease, heretofore irremediable &amp; to which he is himself liable, it will be felt that this design is more comprehensive than ordinary Institutions for the relief of the poor in a state of sickness &ndash; Moderate contributions only are necessary, if the subscription be general; nor will any second donation be solicited.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The design has already found most respectable supporters, whether rank, knowledge or profession be regarded. Among these, it is only necessary to particularise at present the Duke &amp; Duchess of Devonshire,  the Earl of Dartmouth,  Matthew Boulton Esq.,  James Keir Esq,  Rich Kirwan Esq,  &lt;J. More Esq Sec to the Sc of Arts&gt;  James Watt Esq,  Josiah Wedgwood Esq and his sons,  &lt;Joseph Black MD Prof of Chemistry Edin<sup>h</sup>&gt;  J. Currie MD,  Erasmus Darwin MD  J. Ewart MD,  T Hope MD Prof of Medicine, Glasgow,   Dr Ingenhousz,  James Johnstone MD Worcester,  R. White MD St Edmundsbury,  W. Withering MD Birmingham  &ndash; D. Dundas, Sergeant surgeon to his Majesty;  Walter Farquhar Esq Surgeon London  &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &ndash; Persons, disposed to contribute, are desired to give in their names &amp; subscriptions to  [blank space] Banker of this city where a paper by T Beddoes of Bristol Hotwells naming the trustees &amp; describing other particulars may be seen.</p>
