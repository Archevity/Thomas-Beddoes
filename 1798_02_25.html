	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt Jr, 25 February 1798</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"></p> 
 <p style="text-align: right;">25 Feb</p> 
Dear Sir</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am very thankful to your father for Black’s drawings  &amp; to you for giving me your ideas &ndash; I agree with you that Milner’s is a very good syllabus for its period. I need not trouble you to procure me a copy as I have long had &amp; indeed used it at Oxford  &ndash; My intention is to give a syllabus by spurts &ndash; If they have the heads of each lecture before it is given I do not think that not having the whole at first will be a disadvantage &amp; I shall better mature it &ndash; Indeed my time has been exceedingly engaged in the way of my profession &amp; I think I shall not be able to compleat an arrangement of the whole heads before the lectures must begin &ndash; Clayfield  &amp; I like the Irish operator  very well so far</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You may rely on the safe return of Widenmann  &amp; the <i>brasses</i>.  I might perhaps have asked you to lend me his Mineralogy for a few days when I came to that part. But I have succeeded in my endeavours to procure a copy  &ndash;</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Would you dislike to lend me your pechsteins  provided they w<sup>d</sup> not suffer &amp; I promised not to trust them out of my own hands &amp; I found nothing respecting this interesting class in Broderip’s?  I w<sup>d</sup> not wish them till a day or two before I shew them &amp; w<sup>d</sup> return them directly &ndash;</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	W<sup>d</sup> you lend me Crell’s Annalen for 1795, 6, 7 &ndash; for 2 months? </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Perhaps what I am now going to say is like an attempt to borrow the Ark of the Covenant. But as I think that the person asked has as much right to refuse as the asker to ask, &amp; actually regulate my feelings by this principle, so as not to be chagrined by a frank denial, I the less hesitate to express my wish &ndash; you shewed me one of your own or Mr Boulton’s many specimens of Herculaneum glass &ndash; 1, 2, or 3 of these w<sup>d</sup> enliven my hist<sup>y</sup> of Chemistry &ndash; I engage both for keeping them in my own hands &amp; for returning them immediately &ndash; It is for you to estimate the chance of injury during conveyance. Very probably your repugnance to trust such things out of your own keeping may be insuperable &amp; perhaps my own would &ndash; If these curiosities belong to Mr Boulton, I request you &ndash; not to ask him to lend them &ndash; but to mention to him the substance of this page &ndash; If among these specimens ‘antiquae lacidas &amp; artis’ there be any one that can be trusted which shews complication of structure, I sh<sup>d</sup> be glad of that  &ndash;</p> 
<p>4. &nbsp;	&nbsp; I sh<sup>d</sup> be glad to borrow for exhibition a well defined Saxon topaz  &ndash; if Broderip (who has with wonderful liberality or easiness committed his cabinet to my disposal &amp; God send me grace &amp; good luck not injure any specimen) sh<sup>d</sup> happen not to have one &ndash;</p> 
The Crell &amp; the Herc<sup>m</sup> (or either) I sh<sup>d</sup> be glad to have in a fortnight &ndash; the others when I want to shew them &ndash; I shall, as I have intimated, not feel the bitterness of disappointment, if I am not granted any or all of these requests &ndash; But if any impediment (not of the nature of a public disaster) sh<sup>d</sup> prevent you from traversing the Scottish Swaths &amp; Braes, then I shall feel as the Jews by the waters of Babylon when they laid down the harps &amp; wept &ndash; Can you estimate the subjective probability of your going?  &ndash; I am Dear Sir with unfeigned gratitude yours </p> 

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>  

<p>For Mr Watt Sen<sup>r</sup> &ndash; In the Annals of Med. Vol. 2 there is a pretty case of phthisis cured accidentally by mephitic air  &ndash; I have had some curious &amp; distinct facts lately sent by new observers &ndash; which I think to print in a small pamphlet,  partly to let them know we are going on; partly to say the Pneum<sup>c</sup> Inst<sup>n</sup> will be begun early in winter; si deus voluerit &amp; B-n-p-rte  &ndash; If any fine morning within a fortnight, Mr Watt sh<sup>d</sup> be inclined to sing a song or whistle a tune, I wish he w<sup>d</sup> at the same time cut out an elastic transferring tube;  his hands will be at liberty &amp; he w<sup>d</sup> lose, therefore, no time &ndash;</p> 

<p>[in Anna Beddoes’s hand:]</p> 
<p>Please to let me know, and do not, because I am a woman treat me with less candour than you would the dr whether I with my little Maryanne  could be admitted into y<sup>r</sup> delightful Scotch scheme without inconvenience to you; Dr B. is about a p<sup>r</sup>  of travelling horses, he would take the chaise, and walk or ride where you like to go out of the common road; this is not the whole of the explanation, quite as you will conceive. Now though you may not have the honesty to say no downright yet I shall contrive to find out what you wish by the manner in which you express yourself &nbsp;  AMB.</p>
