	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wedgwood [?late November] 1794]</h2>
	
<p>Dear Sir </p>	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I some time since received from Mr Byerley  a letter written by your father’s  direction, stating the subscription of your family & mentioning a scruple on the part of the banker to enter two sets of sums &ndash; one for advertisement &ndash; the other not to be publicly mentioned.  My opinion is that the ostensible subscription is liberal &amp; sufficient. If but a small part of the public subscribes but moderate sums, which I hope will be the case &amp; which, I think, ought to be the case, your generosity may well be transferred to some other object.
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Since my last letter,  some attempts have been made at York &amp; Hull to raise sums for this purpose of ours  &amp; at Berwick upon Tweed the business is already or soon will be set on foot  &ndash; At Edin<sup>r</sup> I am informed the proposal has gained much attention. Two days ago I had advice that the medical society, had unanimously subscribed 25 guineas  &ndash; I think it well to wait yet a few days before I issue a new set of proposals, as some other names of weight may yet be expected &amp; immediately on the opening of the Parliament,  public affairs will engage the whole attention of the nation &ndash; Some names, however, which I wish for, I shall not have for reasons I could easily assign &ndash; &amp; I am afraid as the new practice of medicine becomes formidable from its success a cabal will arise to decry it, perhaps the public may be frightened by their representations &ndash;
 <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> This practice however continues universally successful in cancers &amp; foul ulcers &ndash; That the experience of others confirms my obs<sup>ns</sup>  with regard to phthisis pulm<sup>y</sup> the following extract of a letter from the physician of the Birm. Dispensary will shew.  By the use of the hydrocarbonate   3 persons in the last stage have had their sufferings most materially alleviated but in none of them can I expect a cure. I must say that in one case appearances are very flattering &ndash; the breathing is wonderfully better; the pains on the thorax are removed. The patient c<sup>d</sup> only sleep on one side formerly but now on either, indifferently or on his back. The expectoration evidently purulent, is more than half diminished but the strength does not increase’  &ndash; Two cases of accidental recovery from confirmed phthisis pulmonalis have lately communicated to me, &amp; it seems as if it had been owing in both to a lowered atmosphere  &ndash; One is very curious it is of a negro in the W. Indies, who certainly did inhale such an atmosphere for a constancy &amp; with<sup>t</sup> any &lt;medical&gt; means recovered  I hope to procure it for insertion in a new Ed. of my Observations  &ndash; which will contain some curious communications &ndash; but I have not leisure to prepare it for the press at present.
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am at this moment oxygenating a patient, lately affected with hydrothorax &amp; anasarca &ndash; He declared with<sup>t</sup> any previous intimation that he breathed more freely that his chest seemed expanded &amp;c &ndash; but this is only the 4<sup>th</sup> day of very gradual inhalation  	&ndash; I am 
	D<sup>r</sup> Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Yours with true regard</p>

<p>Tho<sup>s</sup> Beddoes</p>
