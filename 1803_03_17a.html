	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to the Printers of <cite>The Bristol Gazette and Public Advertiser</cite>, 17 March 1803</h2>


<p>TO THE PRINTERS. </p>

<p>From my own observation, and that of a variety of medical men, with whom I have conversed, it appears that the <em>influenza</em> is rapidly spreading through Bristol and the neighbourhood.  No contagious disorder, I believe, is so quick in its course, and so general. This happens from the two following reasons: It is exceedingly infectious, and from several instances I conclude that the symptoms will appear within twenty four hours after the infection is taken. The majority and even the whole of large families fall down together, or within two or three days; yet the manner of life of the members agrees in no one circumstance but that of residing under the same roof.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The rich will have their own medical attendants; but the middling and lower classes, it is to be feared, neglect or (what is worse) endeavour to treat themselves. They will sometimes trust to the foolish recipes, lately communicated through the newspapers, and sometimes adopt the hot regimen: that is, they will take strong things, with a view to produce sweat, drink heated liquids, and keep themselves very warm. Forcing a sweat may now and then kill the complaint; but it will more generally increase the inflammation, and either produce immediate danger or fatal consequences. The very opposite rule, if a general one were laid down, is much the safer. When the chest is oppressed, the cough tight, and the skin dry and hot, few repent of keeping themselves cool, whether up or in bed, drinking cold liquids, and breathing cool air.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It is true that antimonial medicines are very useful in this,  as they have been in former influenzas. But to give a prescription, which shall suit all cases, would be nearly as hopeless as to furnish a coat that shall fit every back in Bristol. Some require to be bled; in others bleeding would induce a state much worse than the disorder itself.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The very young, if attacked, the aged, the consumptive, the puny and infirm in general, will severely suffer, and even be cut off immediately or in the end. In medicine, indeed, there are resources, which if properly employed will prevent this calamity. But how desirable to present the necessity for employing them if possible! This may be attempted in two ways, and will often be accomplished. &ndash; One way is to separate those members of a family, for whom the worst is to be feared, as soon as the disorder appears. With these let neither the infected, nor their attendants, have any communication; and let everything used or worn by the sick be immediately put into water.  In short let all the rules for preventing fevers from spreading be observed. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Of the second method I cannot yet speak with full assurance. I have advised it, because I feel that confidence in it which the closest analogy is calculated to inspire. On board our ships, in our hospitals, in private houses, as also in France and Spain, the fumes of the nitrous and marine acids have been found to destroy, at once, different species of febrile contagion.  The spread of the most fatal maladies has been arrested as soon as they have been employed. I cannot believe that the contagion of the influenza will resist those powerful agents.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">There is not room here for the evidence in favour of acid fumigations, or for the different mixtures. But if a gallipot,  with an ounce or two of oil of vitriol be heated bloodwarm, and half a tea spoonful of common salt or salt-petre added now and then, the protective fumes will be given out.  They need but be barely sensible, not irritating. &ndash; The room where the sick are, should not be fumigated, if the fumes excite coughing. A gallipot should be placed in the apartment of the uninfected, and also in the passage leading to it. Polished steel should be removed or oiled.  </p>
