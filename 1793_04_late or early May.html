	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Davies Giddy, [late April/early May] 1793</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-align: right;">No. 11 Hope Square</p> 
<p style="text-align: right;">Bristol Hotwells</p> 	

<p>Dear Giddy,</p>
	
<p style="text-indent: 20px;">I hope you received my letter from Oxford  – A letter of yours directed to me at Shifnal & written in a manner suited to the gloomy complexion of the times has since reached me. For my own part I have experienced the same viccissitudes of feeling in consequence of the late events in France which I had already experienced on 2 or 3 occasions during the revolution – a great depression (almost amounting to despondency) & afterwards elevation of spirits. In the late occurrences nothing contributed so much to the revival of my hopes as the conduct of Dumourier’s army. I am not acquainted with &lt;such&gt; an effort of virtue shewn by such & so large a body of men under every species of discouragement. Men, capable of adhering so stedfastly to principle & with minds so free from any blind brutish attachment to persons cannot, one w<sup>d</sup> hope, be conquered or enslaved.  I received yesterday from Guillemarde a very encouraging letter.  Having lately traversed a good many of the central counties of England, I have been able to collect a few curious & pretty well authenticated &lt;facts&gt;. Respecting the toy-trade  (the principal trade) of Birmingham, Mr. Keir’s  expression to me was ‘those trades cannot be said to be languishing, they are dead; & perhaps will never revive’. At Birm<sup>h</sup> I received from others a full confirmation of the deplorable state of their manufactures – A Lancashire cotton-weaver said ‘I had 500 looms at work. I have not 30 at present, I wish I had not one’. A Mr Rathbone, a principal merchant at Liverpool, told me that on leaving Liverpool, he was informed that not a single ship was fitting out in that port; he added ‘I did not contradict the assertion, as I did not myself know of any one’.  I asked him how many were usually fitting out at this season – he replied about 300 – The buildings here at Clifton exhibit the most melancholy appearance – you know how numerous they are, 5 weeks ago half the masons & carpenters were discharged; & 3 weeks ago all the remainder – I see not a single labourer at work – not one house in ten is covered in & I am told there is not the smallest chance of their being so before winter – part of the men enlisted – part starving. The great Worcester canal to Birmingham began with great spirit  3 weeks ago 400 hands were discharged, & I am told to day all the rest have been paid off since. Reynolds  told me that all his large orders with<sup>t</sup> exception for pig iron were countermanded – I asked him what proportion the large orders bore to the whole – he said they were as ¾ – 500 workmen in iron are going to be discharged from his works. The poor men have been remonstrating; they ask why should I be discharged rather than another & then mutter out an oath that they will not starve – Lately Plymley, a democratic or semi-democratic parson & archdeacon of Salop  took a very sensible survey of his archdeaconry – it comprehends the mining & pastoral districts of Shropshire – According to a survey about 20 years old, there was not one cottager in 12 who did not keep a pig; now there is not one in 20 who does. I believe that under all expensive i.e. oppressive governments the tillers of the earth are the most burdened. Under the Turkish Government & in India the wretchedness of the peasantry much exceeds that of the artificers – It must needs be so –– </p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px;">I never mentioned the subject of Oxford to you – I thought it too unimportant – but you have mentioned it once or twice; so I suppose you have no objection to hear the manner & cause of my resignation. Last June I went to the V. Chancellor:  this, you see, was before any political ferment took place. I said that I had no desire to read any more lectures; but that as I had given no chemical lectures that year & as I thought it unjustifiable to keep possession of the E lab<sup>y</sup> witht reading lectures & as I c<sup>d</sup> not immediately with convenience remove my specimens &c., I would not formally resign until <i>this</i> summer; I added that I w<sup>d</sup> offer to read <i>this</i> spring & if I had a tolerable class w<sup>d</sup> proceed –That course however sh<sup>d</sup> certainly be the last – & if they w<sup>d</sup> fix upon a successor, I w<sup>d</sup> certainly resign to him this year: & I thought the person, whoever he might be, w<sup>d</sup> be obliged to me for giving him notice so long beforehand – The Vice Chan<sup>r</sup> said, this was extremely liberal ‘but, Sir, as it is much to be desired that some salary sh<sup>d</sup> be annexed to the Chem<sup>l</sup> Chair & we cannot ask it in the name of a person so <i>eminent</i> as yourself, I wish you w<sup>d</sup> draw up a memorial to be sent to the Sec<sup>y</sup> of State & keep the lectureship till an answer be given to that memorial’ – I drew up the memorial, L<sup>d</sup> Guildford  gave it to Dundas,  who as appeared from a letter of L<sup>d</sup> Guildford’s received it very favourably – I went into the country, became <i>eminently</i> & much beyond my importance, odious to Pitt & his gang, as I know from an hundred curious facts  – The memorial from this & other causes was forgotten & destroyed – Adams about Xmas urged me to resign, 1. because I sh<sup>d</sup> have no class & 2. because he thought Stacy w<sup>d</sup> be appointed – I much wished Stacy to succeed me, as he has a large family & w<sup>d</sup>, on account of his being able to make apparatus with his own hands, be likely to give as good a course as any body I knew at Oxford.  I cheerfully resigned & Dr Bourne is appointed.    </p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Pause here </p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px;"><i>The inclosed letter is for your sister</i>; it will be to you a very extraordinary & unexpected inclosure. I did not direct it, lest any accident in opening this letter sh<sup>d</sup> occasion her any disagreeable feelings. My reasons for writing I think you w<sup>d</sup> allow to be satisfactory; to me at least after the most mature deliberation they appear to be so. My only difficulty has been to determine in what way I could get a few lines conveyed to her; & I beg it of you as a favour in which I am much interested to contrive some way of putting it into her hands with<sup>t</sup> giving her any momentary distress. If you can put me upon any better method of transmitting it, be so good as return it me here – I am sure I have not the smallest objection to your knowing the substance; nor much to your reading it, though I confess I w<sup>d</sup> rather it was only <s>written</s> read by the person to whom it is addressed – I hope you will write to me immediately – you may suppose I commit the letter to the post with some anxiety. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Yours</p>
