	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Francis Douce, 29 June 1808</h2>
	
	
<p>Dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It generally happens that the relaxation (which is conspicuous it seems in your uvula &amp; if which the other parts about the fauces participate, I presume descends through all the bronchia &ndash; This is accompanied with a praeternatural sensibility &amp; hence you take cold easily &ndash; It frequently happens that the similar mucous membrane, which divides off into y<sup>e</sup> stomach is &lt;at the same time&gt; relaxed, whence indigestion &ndash; I am not acquainted with the Norwegian instrument for cutting off the end of the uvula &ndash; But sometimes I have advised the operator; &amp; within this month a surgeon performed it on a patient of mine with perfect success by means of a silk ligature &ndash; But it is very seldom necessary &ndash; almost always an astringent gargle often used will reduce the part to its natural size and state &ndash; Such a gargle I have set down no 1  &ndash; In spite of the authority you quote I in y<sup>r</sup> place w<sup>d</sup> plunge my head into cold strong brine daily when the whole skin was drywarm &ndash; The hair may be defended by an oiled silk cap. This will do much to fortify the mucous membrane against impressions of cold &ndash; I have rarely found accumulation of cloathing about the feet effectual agt. cold &ndash; you must make them find their own heat, which with walking a mustard poultice as I have described in y<sup>e</sup> manual will accomplish &ndash; The poultice might be wholly wrapped on a thin handkerchief &amp; so applied without touching the skin &ndash; you w<sup>d</sup> require it almost all flour of mustard &ndash; The misfortune of this is the trouble; but the same poultice heated afresh will do for several times &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Another thing is of consequence &ndash; <em>Whenever you are likely to be exposed the damp or cold, just a bit of ginger or some black pepper corns into your mouth low down &ndash; This stimulus will often defend the parts ag<sup>t</sup> the &lt;causes of that&gt; inflammation which constitutes a cold</em> &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Astringents &amp; balsam, taken into the stomach have very real power in correcting this defeat of the membrane &ndash; No II is an astringent pill &ndash; not astringent with regard to the bowels however &ndash; The balsam of copaiba  is excellent, but disagreeable &ndash; However the gargle, cold dipping &amp; heating the feet are sufficient in most slighter cases &ndash; &amp; every one who can w<sup>d</sup> I imagine avoid internal medicines &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have no objection to any sort of strictures on our profession &ndash; &amp; by no means assume the privilege of abusing it exclusively.  Though the liberties I have taken in this respect have made me very unpopular among my brethren &ndash; But really we are many of us worse than swindlers not only taking people’s money under false pretences but cramming them &lt;too&gt; with nauseous drugs which we know will do no good &ndash; If the public were but informed respg. physiology &amp; pathology to a very practicable degree, this sort of imposition must cease &ndash; &amp; I think it will ere long &ndash; In some important departments of medicine I agree with you that we are not advanced beyond Galen   Indeed in fevers I believe Cullen &amp; the Scotch school went retrograde   But in their knowledge &amp; treatment of inflammatory &amp; some other disorders, a degree of certainty, almost mathematical, has been attained &ndash; &amp; if you consider that in very many cases we can write down beforehand the changes which will be discovered on dissection, you will see that our practice has a much surer aim than that of the antients, who were so little versed in anatomy &ndash; But the unprofessional world is a very ass or buzzard not to see how much preventive medicine is their affair &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The affection of the scrotum is I doubt not a well-known common cutaneous complaint &ndash; the prurigo scroti &ndash; There is no hazard at all in applying goulard  &amp; water to it, when bad &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am obliged by y<sup>r</sup> quotations from Stibbes  &amp; if you will send Borde  &amp;c by any Bristol coach (&ndash; I except only the mail &ndash;) particularly by Fremonts’ coach,  I shall be more obliged still &amp; will return them whenever you fix or in a reasonable time &ndash; Please to direct them to </p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dr Beddoes<br>
	at Mr Mills’s <br>
	Printer<br>
	Bristol</p>

<p>I am sorry I did not know of Dr Coombe’s  inclination to sell his old medical books &ndash; I w<sup>d</sup> have bought them if I c<sup>d</sup> &ndash; I once, at Mr Pinkertons  suggestion, stated a few questions to Dr C. respecting the antiquities of consumption  But he did not think it worth while to answer them or to notice my letter &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have paid attention to foreign books on consumption &amp; have made some personal observations. In Germany, France, Poland &amp;c it is a very common disease, almost as much so in some parts as with us &ndash; what is remarkable is that in the army &amp; navy, it has &lt;of late&gt; amazingly increased &amp; almost taken the place of fever &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The advice to a studious sedentary person to put flannel next the skin is generally very bad &ndash; No doubt, it prevents chill in case of sweating &ndash; but it aggravates that diseased state of the skin, on which too easy &amp; excessive sweating depends &ndash; I feel how difficult it is to get out of bad habits &ndash; Callico with flannel over might possibly be substituted &ndash; &amp; the skin be kept from chill by a hot ointment over the chest &ndash; woollen is an excellent dress for the peasantry &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Mr Walpole’s  case does not present a very difficult problem &ndash; that is &ndash; you can refer it to its analogies &ndash; which is all that can be said &lt;in explanation&gt; of any medical or physical phaenomenon whatever.  His skin was highly susceptible of certain impressions, as the sun’s heat; but the mucous membrane of the chest had not undergone that change which renders people so liable to catch cold &ndash; There are many very weak people in whom that part is not so altered &ndash; &amp; this inequality in the condition of organs is a fact that daily occurs &ndash; </p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I remain <br>
	Dear Sir<br>
	very respectfully yours</p>
<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>
<p>29 June 1808</p>
