	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wilkinson, 11 August 1800 </h2>
	
	
<p>My dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am much obliged by your remittance of £282 pounds  &ndash; We have now ascertained the air to be a cure of palsy in a large proportion of cases  &ndash; I remember once conversing with you about nitrous acid as a medicine in venereal diseases &ndash; You told me that Sir W. Farquhar assured you it was a good thing but not a cure for those affections &ndash; I have no great faith in Sir W nor in any fashionable physician &ndash; &amp; I have in my hands proofs which I am sure will satisfy a great part of the &lt;faculty &amp; of the&gt; public that nitrous acid will cure this complaint in all its stages &ndash; It is astonishing to what a pitch of perfection this method has been carried &ndash; And what is happy for humanity, patients emerge from this treatment fat &amp; strong; instead of being pulled down &amp; thrown into consumption when they are weakly as by mercury as by mercury  &ndash; Between 2000 &amp; 3000 cases are now accurately registered &ndash; &amp; it is demonstrable where people have failed that they have failed from improper administration of the remedy  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">But I beg pardon for the detail  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The boys are strong &amp; do not suffer under the heat &ndash; However there are indubitable signs about John of a constitution prone to consumption.  Though stout &amp; healthy, the bleeding from his nose &amp; the state of his glands with other appearances demonstrate the necessity of persevering to guard his constitution against this fatal calamity &ndash; I have of course stated this to his mother &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">If you remember, the boys began Latin last October, what would you suppose may be their proficiency? &ndash; I think that they understand the grounds &amp; construction most perfectly, so far as they have gone &ndash; &amp; &lt;by October next&gt; I will answer for their getting with the most perfect ease a lesson in Ovid’s metamorphoses  &ndash; Would you believe that they teaze me half a dozen times a day to let them read Ovid to me, &amp; to help them out where they are at a loss. I myself &lt;at first&gt; read them a few lines every day &ndash; they were perfectly captivated with the story of Phaeton  &ndash; &amp; now they apprehend many passages which they have never seen before, immediately on reading them.   I have had an opportunity of comparing them with one or two quick boys about their own age, who have been at Latin &ndash; These boys are a little before J &amp; W in books, but in another twelvemonth our boys will distance them &ndash; &amp; even now the other boys can only just stupidly repeat the very words they have got by rote &ndash; J &amp; W can put the sense into their own words &amp; give as many examples as you please. &ndash; We have lost M. D’Estrade  &ndash; but got I think a still better master in his stead &ndash; this new master says J &amp; W are the most intelligent children he ever saw &ndash; &amp; that coming from others to teach them is quite a recreation. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">What they have learned has seemed their own choice &ndash; it has scarce ever been against their will &ndash; they are very equal in apprehension &ndash; John is certainly as clever as his brother &ndash; </p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">With comp<sup>ts</sup> to Mrs W<br>
	I am Dr Sir yours most truly</p>

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>
