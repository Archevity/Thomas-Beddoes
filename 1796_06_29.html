	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Davies Giddy, 29 June 1796</h2>
	
<p>Dear Giddy </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I want to know whether you have got my panegyric on Pitt  &ndash; The bookseller has not done it justice, having never I believe advertised it. If I did not think him an honest man &amp; the minister perfectly callow, I sh<sup>d</sup>  suspect foul play.  However the thing is making its way silently in the world, &amp; amazes those who already thought ill of Pitt. It w<sup>d</sup>  have been senseless to write a common-place political pamphlet; &amp; it will not do much good to write an uncommonplace one, even if better than others by all the difference. I wait for the bookseller’s orders to compleat it by adding an acc<sup>t</sup>  of his war administration, to which I c<sup>d</sup>  give more poignancy than the last has &ndash; not by a dull detail of events but by painting his councils in [<s>xxxx</s>] true &lt;lively&gt; colours &ndash; It sh<sup>d</sup>  be short &amp; bitter  &ndash; I was surprized by a passage in a letter from Lambton today announcing an idea <s>on the</s> as current among violent Pittites of Fox coming in to make peace  &ndash; They only regret that he sh<sup>d</sup>  have expressed himself so strongly on the hustings.  However I do not think Fox will relax. He must at his time of life &amp; from the late experience of the world be so convinced of the absurdity &amp; wickedness of old ministerial management that he will not, I imagine, come into power at all  &ndash; For I do not see how his terms can be agreed to without innovations that will be thought, &amp; perhaps really will be, hazardous &ndash; I believe also Ld Lansdown is sick of statesmanship.  A letter I had from him the other day  deserves to be printed with that letter of Mad. Maintenon, which Voltaire has inserted in his Louis XIV.  </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You have seen Darwin’s Vol II, which I think surpasses the promise of the first, &amp; will place &lt;the author&gt; among the greatest of mankind &ndash; the founders of sciences  &ndash; Mr. Watt goes on improving the air-apparatus &ndash; &amp; I endeavour to increase the powers of the airs &ndash; he has just printed an acc<sup>t</sup>  of a simplified apparatus, which will soon be manufactured &amp; will suit a kitchen or parlour common fire.  My opinion of the permanent benefit which will be derived from the scheme is daily confirmed by facts. I shall soon finish another pamphlet, but as I had collected before, I will now select  &ndash; You will be surprized to hear that money enough to make a good series of trials is subscribed.  Now the object is to devise a good plan.  I almost shrink from the idea of carrying it into execution myself. </p>  
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Donne I believe goes on well with his models. He has got a noble list of subscribers. </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">My wife is in Ireland.  I have desired her to return in Sept<sup>r</sup>  early. I hope she will &ndash; &amp; then we shall be glad to find your sister retains her resolution of venturing into the world  &ndash; I will let you know &ndash; the decline of summer will plead  more eloquently than I can against delay &ndash; Darwin had projected a poem on the progress of society  &ndash; a Mr Knight has just published one, containing much falsehood no nonsense &amp; little poetry.  I hope Darwin will write a continued poem on some subject &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I find by a note from Ly J. James that she has met with you.  Sir W. is a curious character &ndash; much anecdote from observation or conversation, no reading, no reflection &ndash; strong sense &amp; boyish propensities &ndash; Remember me to all your family &amp; all my W-of-Cornwall acquaintance</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Yr<sup>s</sup> truly</p> 

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p>
