	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wedgwood, 3 August 1797</h2>
	
	

 <p style="text-align:right">Aug<sup>t</sup> 3</p> 
<p>Dear Sir</p> 
 	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am glad you agree with me in thinking my removal  may well be delayed by a few months: And it also gives me sincere satisfaction that you approve the plan of the Bristol lectures.  My wish is to make them interesting &amp; talked of in other places if possible. The two young men who have engaged to deliver them are extremely well qualified  &ndash; I shall do every thing I can think of that may conduce to their success &ndash; The object will be to select such subjects as can be treated in a manner useful to individuals &amp; families &ndash; If we succeed here, a similar plan w<sup>d</sup> more certainly in town?  &amp; it w<sup>d</sup> be easy to find one or two young surgeons who would undertake the course &ndash; I would take a part or not just as might be judged adviseable. I know very well that some at least of my chemical lectures at Oxford were dull &ndash; The subject is often so to those who look only to be entertained by shewy experiments &ndash; &amp; I was often unwell &ndash; However, when the matter was to their taste, I found the hearers were abundantly interested &ndash; I had greater classes than any lecturer before or since &ndash; I once gave a compendious course in mineralogy &amp; had a crowded audience of whom more than half were from 40 to 80 years of age &ndash; &amp; the attendance never slackened. Frequently in the drier parts of the later chemical courses I felt the &lt;same&gt; want of interest as my auditors &ndash; Those lectures were stupid enough &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As to the application of the arts to &lt;popularise&gt; physiological knowledge observe only what a profession of labour has been bestowed on the pernicious nonsense of Lavater.  That interest may be excited by a medical publication Buchan is a proof  &ndash; Now do you not think one might interest some anatomists &amp; several engravers in a work of preventive medicine.  Fine engravings would surely add to the interest of the work &amp; may be made subservient to useful information &ndash; &amp; I think the artists w<sup>d</sup> be content with contingent profits.  Preventive medicine has never been cultivated, though it is much the most important of the two divisions. The faculty had no motive to attend to it; &amp; the public has never felt its importance &ndash; though I believe they may now be brought by proper measures to be sensible to it &ndash; Since I saw you I have had strict enquiry made concerning the state of health among the Bristol Butchers. The information is curious, &amp; satisfactory. As a check upon Bristol, I mean to extend the enquiry through Bath &amp; Worcester &ndash; The result, I believe, will be of great use to my essay on consumption. </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have sent your brothers 5 Guineas to Dr Hamilton  &ndash; &amp; remain yours very truly</p> 

<p>Thomas Beddoes </p> 

<p>I have a valuable report from the royal hospital at Plymouth respecting the use of nitric acid in lues V  &ndash; Its powers in 60 selected bad cases appeared superior to those of &#9791; [mercury] &ndash; &amp; no debility hectic fever or other fever occurred during its use.  The report is sent to me to publish &ndash; &amp; this I shall do directly  &ndash;</p>
