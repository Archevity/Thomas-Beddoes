	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to the Editor of <cite>A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts</cite>, 10 September 1808 </h2>
	
	
<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
	<p>I never regarded the base of the alkalis as belonging to the metallic order of combustibles, or projected their reduction by galvanism or electricity.  But long ago, on contemplating all other substances in opposition to oxigen it very naturally occurred, that, since alkalis and earths would not burn or absorb oxigen, they might be already saturated with it. This investigation, caused by Tondi’s paper,  would have been, had it operated at all, a discouragement to the idea, which was certainly formed on different grounds, and existed, I believe, prior to my acquaintance with those facts. Such as it was conceived, it happened to be long afterwards thrown out in an essay on the arrangement of bodies on the principle alluded to above. As a distinct fourth class of bodies I had arranged together barytes, strontites, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, alumine, jargonites, silex, &amp;c., adding this query ‘Does the mode of union of their elements render them nonoxidable? or have they already oxigen or phosoxigen closely combined?’ and again ‘If future experiments should accomplish the oxidation of any of the bodies of the fourth class, such bodies must be transferred to the third class (termed philoxigenous). Should it be discovered, that oxigen enters into their composition, the terms philoxigenous and misoxigenous must be changed*’.  </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I had observed, p. 218, that, “more than mere classification, I had it in view to place under the reader’s eye certain probabilities, that might lead to the analysis of different bodies, at present considered as simple.” This application of electricity is a project, which has lain on the surface of chemistry for above twenty years. I have taken all opportunities, public and private, of pressing its execution. The bodies I have been accustomed to name as the proper subjects for trial were the fusible combustibles, as sulphur and phosphorus. A gentleman, illustrious for his late success in these researches, some time ago mentioned to me his having made this experiment with galvanism.  The result was the liberation of some vapours or gas, which disappeared again before the body congealed. The mode of investigation should, in my opinion, still be prosecuted with a much higher power than has yet been employed. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As an incentive and a clew to experiment (which is the only use of hypothesis) I beg leave to repeat, that <em>metals and other combustibles may be formed of hidrogen and azote</em>. The opinion has gained some countenance from the analogy between volatile and fixed alkalis, together with the identification of the base of the fixed with metals. The reported amalgamation of the base of volatile alkali with quicksilver  is an important link in the same chain of ideas; though the amalgamation of charcoal with iron, &amp;c. may be opposed, unless charcoal prove a metallic oxide or hidrogenate.  </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">One cannot proceed far in this train of speculation without getting the prospect of all nature as consisting of two elements, oxigen and hidrogen.  </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In respect to heat, light, electricity, galvanism, and magnetism, I see not the smallest reason to regard these as distinct substances, or other than as powers or influences, if we are not to follow Berkeley.  We have no right to consider any property whatever as essential to matter. We have therefore no criterion of materiality. Yet it appears to me, that the absence of gravitation is a much stronger negative argument than any positive yet produced: and I have no doubt but all those who have set themselves to weigh <em>caloric</em>, under the notion of its being a separate substance, have been miserably disappointed at the result of their experiment; and that, had the result been opposite, they would have triumphed, and justly, in this proof; for it must have been received as decisive. Have not adversaries a right to retaliate?  </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The genius of accurate experimental investigation may be now in the art of striding from inanimate to living nature; very soon afterward one may venture to predict, that other influences, offering other means of analysis, will be discovered, less extensive probably than heat, and more so than magnetism, and constituting the difference between the particles of matter as they happen to be engaged in one class of compounds or the other. The Archaeus,  vital principle, Mr Hunter’s material vitae diffusa,  &amp;c, will perhaps come to be considered as anticipations (clumsy and illogical ones indeed) of such influences. </p>
