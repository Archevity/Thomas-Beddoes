	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Maria Thompson, [?1799&ndash;1800] (1)</h2>
	
<br>	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Your sister  says that you are very industrious; and that you read a great deal.  I am very glad to hear this; not that I think reading a great deal, absolutely and inevitably, a good thing. It is often a very bad thing, as I think that you will easily perceive upon a little consideration; though probably I have had more opportunities of knowing in what respects it is bad, than you have. In general, whatever reading creates no disposition to observe nature or life, soon cloys; and in such reading, all degrees of feeling are experienced, from keen relish, through indifference, to satiety. Have you no acquaintance who resort to a book to keep themselves from yawning, and often without finding the intention answered? Now, at some former period, it is ten to one but the very same book would have given the very same person exquisite entertainment. I believe, all books that do not refer to some natural object or to some general question, come under this description. But is it not curious enough that there should be a kind of reading which proceeds in exactly the reverse order; beginning in indifference or aversion, and perpetually increasing in interest as you go on? This is the case with almost every kind of science after the elements are mastered; and the examples of Law, Mathematics, and so on, are a standing paradox to desultory readers, who can never comprehend the increasing ardour of their respective students, because the fact is so contrary to their own experience.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Science of every kind is to be recommended, because some degree of bodily exertion is indispensable in most sciences; and books alone, must some time or other induce languor. In your situation, I know the difficulty of putting in practice any thing <em>you</em> might wish of this kind.  But I am mistaken if you have not an active curiosity and a firm mind; and these will conquer, in a great measure, the disadvantages of situation. You will ask me what you can possibly do? I see no physical science you can meddle with, except Botany; and what is usually called understanding botany, is only the art of readily finding out the name of a plant, in a catalogue very ingeniously arranged by Linnaeus. But this is worth while, as in making out the name, you must observe some curious things; and as discoveries respecting the qualities of plants are hourly making, which can have little interest, except to those who have a knowledge of the particular plants in question. You may, ere very long, be in a situation to command all the resources of science and literature. You can very easily make yourself mistress of Arithmetic, which you will find very useful and agreeable, <em>after a time</em>, and why you should not go on to some Mathematics afterwards, I cannot conceive.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You will find a prodigious advantage in some connected study, if you meet with incidents in life that wound your sensibility. And those who have the habit of resorting to any occupation, when they feel the first sting from disappointed ambition or love, will much less often grow mad or miserable than their neighbours.
