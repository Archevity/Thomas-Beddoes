	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, 24 February 1796</h2>
	
	
<p style="text-align: right;">24 Feb 1796</p> 
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The 3<sup>rd</sup>  Ed of the Consid<sup>ns</sup>  must be ready, but I have not seen a copy of it. The sheets went from this place to town last week &ndash; the plates Johnson <i>wd</i> <i>have</i> taken off in London  &ndash; I did order a few copies to be left here, but I suppose the printers did not choose to be at the trouble of taking them out &ndash; otherwise I should have sent you one. I have mentioned in the new preface your design of printing something.  I asked for permission to do this &amp; interpreted silence into consent &ndash; I do not see any cause for believing Miss J. C. to have water in the head.  I have seen a good deal of hydrocephalus internus &ndash; &amp; think it is not that &ndash; for that seems to be an acute disease with a regular period, as you will see in the appendix to Zoonomia Vol 2 &ndash; where Darwin has inserted my opinion in opposition to his own, which however he seems to have abandoned in great measure if not altogether  &ndash; Now hydrocephalus is a palpable disease &ndash; I have frequently given 12&ndash;15 drops of Fowler’s solution  &ndash; of 4 grs arsenic to &#8485;i of water; &amp; one patient continued this near half a year with perfect recovery.</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I will try the rot<sup>y</sup>  couch again as soon as I can &ndash; I have proposed it 2 or 3 times without success &ndash; &amp; see Darwin, vol. II. mentions it as from myself  &ndash; now I did [<s>xxxx</s>] deduce the idea from somethings in his book, but he had the rotatory couch from me &amp; forgot it, as one of his letters would prove.  I mention this merely in explanation privately, to you &ndash; I did not understand from your former letter that you wished to have the tube for manganese, desulphurated once for all &ndash; I have a patient here who takes ox. air for a singular &amp; I believe an unprecedented state of mind with contusions &amp; convulsions of the body.  He thinks himself better, but says the air of 4 days standing even makes him giddy. But he absorbs it so greedily that I believe the giddiness depends on the mechanical cause &ndash; at least, I shall try tomorrow. </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">A Dr Lawrence of Swaffham Norfolk writes me word that he has found advantage from the use of airs &amp; promises particulars  &ndash; Dr Girtanner has published trials &amp; as I am informed successful ones &ndash; 1/3 fixed air as he says has cured consumption.  I must try to get his book &ndash; I have a curious case at Kidderminster,  wherein I hope &amp; expect decisive advantage from oxygene &ndash;  I am informed that Mr Hare has been much the better for oxygene this winter &ndash; but I wish for confirmation from himself &ndash; &amp; hope to receive it.  </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am not able to say anything of the <i>new</i> air  &ndash; as poor Mrs Kerr did not remain to try it, &amp; I have had no patient since who seemed to require. Dr Cox will procure me the most precise ideas on the power of the various hydrocarbonates in mania &amp; some epilepsies, of which cases his house if full  &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have mentioned to Mr Keir a plan now executing by a poor &amp; ingenious old man here: Benj. Donne.  It is a box of models &amp;c with a book to teach plane &amp; solid geometry mechanically. I spent an hour twice in examining his demonstrations; &amp; they seem to me to be exceedingly ingenious. A very young student would learn from them the fundamental propositions, &amp; that with pleasure.  They will therefore be of use to persons, interested in education.  He does not mean to make more than shall be bespoke; &amp; he has orders for as many as he thinks worth setting about.  I am sorry that the price is so high as two guineas. I do mention this with any idea of solicitation, but if you know any person who would like to have such an article, it would give me pleasure to procure the author an additional customer.</p> 
	I think Miss C. should go on with the arsenic a month or 5 weeks &ndash; R. W. is got well by help of punch &ndash; The digitalis, fully tried, certainly failed. The use of the palsied foot returned.  Warm bathing (semicupium ) was used latterly &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am D<sup>r</sup>  Sir y<sup>rs</sup>  truly</p> 

<p>Thomas Beddoes </p>
