	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to William Withering, 9 March 1799 </h2>
	
	

 <p style="text-align: right;">9 March 
<p>I beg an answer of but 3 lines as soon as is perfectly convenient</p> 

<p>Dear Sir,</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have long felt an inclination to trouble you with a few lines. But I was afraid from what I heard of
the state of your health to put you to the inconvenience of an answer.  A couple of years ago I mentioned to you my design to arrange some papers respecting the causes &amp; signs of consumption.  The more I considered the subject, the more I felt disposed to defer the execution of my purpose. But two valuable communications on the treatment of this disease for the <i>contributions to Med<sup>l</sup> &amp; Physical science</i> (a work which is to appear in a very few days) incline me to think this a favourable moment for exciting the attention of the public to the whole subject.</p>  
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I found a good deal upon your observation respecting butchers. No doubt the observation was with you original.  Have you since met with anything similar in books. I have not &amp; the only thing approaching to it occurs in a thesis at Montpellier in 1788 of which I got knowledge by mere accident. </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In a letter of yours you say you suspect snufftakers to be less liable to phthisis. If you chuse, I w<sup>d</sup> add this to the quotation from your printed letter, but by no means unless it was quite satisfactory to you.  I have no interest in suggesting this to you. I only feel it a duty to notice a very authentic or probable fact, which I can fairly obtain.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">May I ask if you intend soon to publish your Lisbon obs<sup>ns</sup>.  I have alluded in a single sentence to what I heard you say of the unfavourableness of the Portuguese climate. This is of importance to one part of my reasoning, &amp; I hope you will not be offended at the liberty.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">We open our pneumatic hospital on Wednesday next.  A circular prospectus will be sent round next week requesting suggestions.  I shall not say how highly I think of the young man who is to superintend it.  His papers <i>in the contributions</i> will put every philosoph<sup>l</sup> physician in a capacity to judge whether I overrate him. </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Considering the times, we push on the diffusion of science pretty well here. We have had 2 anatomical courses for men &amp; 2 select ones for women these 2  last winters.  Linnaeus Smith  comes in May to lecture us in botany.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am entirely persuaded of the antisiphylitic virtue of nitrous acid &amp; oxyg. muriate.  But I dare not say a word of its power as compared with that of &#9791;.<sup>1</sup>  That remains to be settled. </p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I am Dear Sir<br>
respectfully yours</p> 

<p> Thomas Beddoes</p> 


<p><b>Address: Dr. Withering / Physician / near Birmingham <br>
Endorsement: Beddoes Doc<sup>t</sup> 9th March - Answ<sup>d</sup> 14th March 1799. / Still no consumptive
Butchers &ndash; believe the remark to be my own. / One Snufftaker died of a consumption caught of his Brother (Mr. Legge) / 
Stable Boys breathing warm air &amp; &#415;^<sup>2</sup>  I think exempt. /    
Propose to get returns of Cons: deaths from all the Hospit<sup>ls</sup> Dispens. &amp; even private pract: 
in England for 1 or 2 years, with the Habits &amp; occupations of the patients. / Perhaps the climate of Port<sup>l</sup> is rather 
inefficacious than unfavourable in consumpt. cases. Rather wish he should elucidate his opinions by the climates of France or Italy.
Hope to publish my Lisbon Obs: this year. / Wish the deep insp: of common Air fixed in sev<sup>l</sup> diseases, 
such as cold extremities, &amp; Asthma attended with debility. Wish the Reports of Cases to be made by the Phys<sup>n</sup> &amp; 
not by the patient or the Apothecary. / Does a scorbutic diathesis  enable the  &#10678;<sup>3</sup> to cure siphyllis? 
We cannot cure by it alone. / Has he seen Bristol &#9947; <sup>4</sup>    cure Diabetes? &amp; if so to what can its efficacy be owing?<br>
