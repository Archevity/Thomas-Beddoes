	<h2>Anna Beddoes and Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, 27 October 1806</h2>
	
<p style="text-align: right;">Clifton</p>


<p>My dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I fear you will feel disappointed at seeing my hand writing instead of Dr Beddoes’s but I felt the kindness of your letter so forcibly, that I could not repress the desire it inspired of expressing the very great pleasure it gave me &ndash; Since Dr Beddoes’s illness he has received many flattering proofs of the interest his friends take in his welfare but your letter comes so warm from the heart that it is particularly striking; the advice you give was much wanted, and from you it will most probably be attended with good effects, as I believe he has no friend whose opinion has more weight with him than yours  &ndash; From what those say who ought to know, he is so unwilling to allow the nature of his disorder, that I cannot help fancying he does not treat himself properly  he is surprisingly recovered, yet he always complains of rheumatic pain, particularly about the arms, and shoulders, but several medical men say that this very pain is a symptom of water on the chest &ndash; he is so obstinate on this subject and from my ignorance I incapable of doing any good that I wish exceedingly such friends as from their knowledge have that power over his mind which I have no right to expect would use it to lead him right, for I am convinced that a physician is the last person to be consulted in his own case, in this instance if it had not been for the skill &amp; unremitting attention of his medical friends I am sure he would not now have been living, yet Dr B is so infatuated that he would tell you they did him no good (<em>this is however in confidence</em>)   As Dr Beddoes finds me writing to you he says he will take the next page, so my dear Sir hoping you will excuse the liberty I have taken, &amp; wishing you and your family every happiness</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Believe me your very gratefully</p>

<p>A M Beddoes</p>

<p>[in Beddoes’s hand:] </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Nobody’s admonitions w<sup>d</sup> rouse me more than yours &ndash; But, my dear Sir, I am very good &ndash; you cannot imagine a creature better &ndash; to himself &ndash; accordingly, so far I seem to have proceeded regularly in the road of improvement. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Poor Dr Archer possessed the qualities, which after all make the best part of a social being; &amp; though you smiled at him, you could not but esteem him  &ndash; I am concerned to hear that Dr Carmichael,  who has so [MS torn] more merit than pretensions, is obliged to migrate for he a[MS torn] [MS torn]ton  ever fully tried the uva ursi  [MS torn] his canulous irritations?  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I do not, any more than you augur favourably for Prussia in her contest of despair.  Yet sh<sup>d</sup> despair give so much of that extra force which shall enable her to keep France at bay but a little while, Austria must cooperate with her from the same motive; &amp; to defend the extensive frontier of his diversified usurpations may embarrass even Buonaparte, if another enemy of moderate power should arise. It is difficult to imagine that so many odious &amp; formidable qualities can combine in another mortal.  But will not his spirit, the spirit of the French, survive in his successor?  This more than any other people seems eager to follow any man who will lead them to victory or even to battle. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I should think that Mrs Watt’s complaint  arises from one set of vessels (arteries?)  bringing blood faster than others can take it back so the use of leeches with Epsom salts or other cathartic occasionally w<sup>d</sup> keep the symptoms under &ndash; My best regards to all friends about you &ndash; I am my dear Sir yr<sup>s</sup>very sincerely</p>
