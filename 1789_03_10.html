	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to William Withering, 10 March 1789</h2>
	
<p> Dear Sir,</p>
	
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have not been inattentive amid a sufficient hurry of business to your commissions. I do not find that any medical person here has received any of the printed letters: & therefore I have followed your directions in keeping your statement by me.  I hear but perhaps am misinformed that there has been another publication by D. on the subject. </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I did not expect any success in my enquiries among the Oxford booksellers for Dillenius:  & I am sorry to add that I have not been disappointed. It must be a rare accident that sh<sup>d</sup> bring or detain any scarce & valuable work among them, their collections being confined to lecture-books & Greek Latin, & English Classicks.</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Dr. Priestly has sent me his third paper & I am now constrained to relinquish the beautiful system of Lavoisier, at least the antiphlogistic part of it.  He shewed me a curious phenomenon respecting the iron tube he uses for mif<sup>t</sup>   air & I sent him what I imagine to be the true explanation of it.  I know not whether he has thought it worth imparting to the Society of Birmingham Philosophers. </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The spirit of Chemistry has almost evaporated at Oxford, as indeed I always expected it w<sup>d</sup> . The young men are generally speaking regardless of every thing; & as there are few amusements here, they spend their time in the most stupid kind of dissipation imaginable; often sitting together & gaping at one another the whole day through. They find that when they have taken the degree of M.A. that they know little or nothing & then the better sort think it high time to bestir themselves. Accordingly my class was chiefly composed of the senior members of the University & still those who attend now for the third time make a considerable part of it. But their curiosity, as far as can be done in an elementary course, must be satisfied; & perhaps in half a dozen years more there will arise another race of men desirous to know something of this branch of Nat. Philosophy. At present, the stock of curiosity seems nearly exhausted. </p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Walker has frozen &#9791; several times this winter; twice in my presence during the last snow.  It is certainly not a perfect metal, having scarce more malleability than some of the semi-metals. It was each time frozen very hard, & a very small q<sup>ty</sup>  (3 dr<sup>s</sup>  perhaps) took 7 minutes in thawing. Yet no sooner had I flattened it a little than the edges began to crack & the whole mass soon broke into several pieces. I have not yet found time to draw up my paper.  Dr Thomson  thinks the specimens I shewed him exceedingly curious, & he agrees with me that they will tend very much to establish the igneous theory of the earth. </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am, D<sup>r</sup> Sir, yours respectfully </p> 

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p> 

<p>10th March 1789</p>
