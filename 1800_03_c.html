	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Thomas Wilkinson, [March 1800] </h2>
	
	
<p>Dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Thank you for your information &amp; for your correction of my arithmetic &ndash; I have just drawn on Mess<sup>r</sup>. Boldero  for ninety nine pounds 18 sh &amp; 10d &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I rejoice in your decision as in the redemption of the boys from danger  during an important period &ndash; Hitherto you have wisely looked to the prevention of consumption as a prime object &ndash; You will doubtless continue to <del>to</del> feel that by delivering your wards into their own keeping with a good constitution you will have conferred a more precious obligation upon them than by your care of their property &ndash; You have read <em>the three warnings</em> &ndash; In the present case there have been three warnings as distinct, I am sure, as those received by Mrs. Thrale’s old man  viz. the fate of two predecessors  (immediate predecessors) and John’s make &amp; symptoms. I know for certain that the foundation of many premature deaths from consumption is laid at school &amp; confirmed at college: And there exist the clearest medical reasons for withholding the inheritors of the disposition to consumption from great schools as long as possible. I know very well how rarely medical grounds have influence in the disposal of children &ndash; And so much the worse for children that they have not &ndash; When you thus make public or private education <em>a question upon the case</em>, you can often determine satisfactorily &ndash; But when education, like other things, is talked of in the abstract, you can never come to an issue &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You may have observed how little teachers of youth in general are encumbered with knowledge of the human mind or the human body. This, I take it, is the case more especially with the masters of the great schools &ndash; Their glory seems to consist in a knack at making verse of little use &amp; in a readiness at applying grammar rules, fabricated by schoolmen &ndash; rules at which the great writers of Greece &amp; Rome w<sup>d</sup> have spurned &ndash; &amp; which the great modern writers of language have demonstrated to be nonsensical or absurd &ndash; So that even in their <em>own</em> narrow department the ideas of schoolmasters w<sup>d</sup> appear to be narrow or false &ndash; And for the life of me I scarce see to what their instruction tends but to injure strong minds &amp; destroy weak ones. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Of the arts &amp; genius of antiquity I w<sup>d</sup> have these boys have a perfect idea &ndash; But the pedantry of our public schools seems to me declining in esteem &ndash; &amp; it cannot be much longer in coming home to people’s reflection that it was not to be crammed with this trash that God created the human memory &ndash; but to be furnished with things useful in after-life &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It is, I think, from the Schoolfellows &amp; not by their masters that the pupils of public schools profit &ndash; I esteem most highly the use which boys are of to boys. &ndash; But at public schools they are too much together &ndash; &amp; the use degenerates into abuse &ndash; If some are corrected, more are, I am afraid, corrupted &ndash; It seems manifest that without intermixt. of persons of different sexes &amp; ages there can be neither good morals nor good manners &ndash; Young persons particularly countenance &amp; encourage one another in vice &amp; folly &ndash; Boys’ plays also I take to be a great evil &ndash; They learn nothing useful behind whereas children might be instructively exercised with equal pleasure to themselves &amp; benefit to their health  &ndash; Will all this approximate your opinions to those of your sincere ser<sup>t</sup> Thomas Beddoes? </p>
