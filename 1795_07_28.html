	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Erasmus Darwin, 28 July 1795</h2>
	
	
<p>Master L——, aged 9 years, became suddenly ill in the night about a week before I saw him.  On the day before the attack, he had taken opening medicines, and had bathed afterwards. He had complained of violently acute pain in his head, shrieked frequently, ground his teeth hard, could not bear to have his head raised from the pillow, and was torpid or deaf. His tongue was white, pulse 110 in the evening and full. As yet the pupil of the eye was irritable, and he had no strabismus. He had been bled with leeches about the head, and blistered. I directed mercurial inunction, and calomel from 3 to 6 grains to be taken at first every six, and afterwards every three hours. This plan produced no sensible effect, and the patient died on the 18th day after the seizure. He had convulsion fits two days preceding his death, and the well-known symptoms of hydrocephalus internus all made their appearance. From what I had seen and read of this disease, I believed it to belong to inflammations, and at an earlier period I should be tempted to bleed as largely as for pneumonia. The fluid found after death in the ventricules of the brain I impute to debility of the absorbents induced by inflammation. My reasons are briefly these; 1. The acuteness of the pain. 2. The state of the pulse. In the above case for the first 9 or 10 days it did not exceed 110, and was full and strong.</p> 
<p>3. To find out whether any febrile alternations took place, Master L.'s feet were frequently felt, and they were found at times cold, and at other times of a dry heat. I have many times seen this disease, but the patients were too young, or too far advanced, to inform me, whether they had chillness succeeded by heat at its onset. 4. The disorders to which the young are more peculiarly liable afford a presumption, that hydrocephalus internus is an inflammatory disease; and this is confirmed by the regularity of the period, within which it finishes its course. And lastly, does it not happen more frequently than is suspected from external injury?</p> 
<p>I have just now been well informed, that Dr. Rush has lately cured five out of six patients by copious bleedings.  I relate here the reasons for an opinion without pretending to a discovery. Something like this doctrine may be found in certain modern publications, but it is delivered in that vague and diffuse style, which I trust your example will banish from medical literature.</p>
