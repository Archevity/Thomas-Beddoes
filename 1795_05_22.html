	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to Davies Giddy, 22 May 1795</h2>
	
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">22 May &ndash;</p> 
<p>Dear Giddy</p> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You will see by the papers that the new Ed. of my Considerations is out.  I wish I c<sup>d</sup> put it into your hands; it is nearly a new book, only 50 out of 220 pp. being the same as in the former edition &ndash;  It contains many new &amp; important facts, both in the shape of physiological exp<sup>s</sup> &amp; cases. The practice is extending &amp; I have already some interesting communications towards an appendix  &ndash; On consideration I did not use your testimony. Dr Trotter’s book was much less offensive than his title; after all, these altercations springing from egotism afford no self-approbation. 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have a favour to ask of you or rather 2 favours. Lord Stanhope  has written me a very elaborate letter on the nature of mathematical reasoning: he contends that it does not proceed on exp<sup>t</sup> or observation. But I think he reasons experimentally himself &ndash; I wish you first to read his letter &amp; give me your opinion:  (You will do this; I doubt not) &ndash; &amp; 2. to state explicitly &amp; with your reasons annexed the result of your own reflections on the question. I have proposed to L<sup>d</sup> Stanhope to print his letter as an appendix to my pamphlet;   to this, he does not object, but wishes first to see what  is said in reply or confirmation, for I told him I w<sup>d</sup> refer to a 3rd person or persons as arbitrators &ndash; &amp; if they w<sup>d</sup> consent, I w<sup>d</sup> put the whole, to the press &ndash; &amp; this is what I sh<sup>d</sup> wish for your permission to do with respect to your remarks.  You see there needs not enter any altercation into the controversy &ndash; &amp; L<sup>d</sup> Stanhope has a good object in view, as will appear from his letter &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The world seems very quiet at present. I am looking first to one place &amp; then to another for new mischief to break out; &amp; am in doubt whether Ireland or the Mediterranean will have the honour of being the scene of the Devil’s first operations; for you must know that I am acquainted with a clergyman who says that the Almighty has relinquished this globe of ours to the Devil as a plaything.  I really think the hypothesis deserves some attention. </p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You know Sir Fred. Ede[MS torn]  returned re infectâ.  Have you heard what the committee of public safety said to him. It was an answer in the Spartan or Roman fashion. Sir Fred. represented that he was come with a design to procure the liberty of the British sailors &amp; soldiers &amp; in return to propose the liberation of the French.  He was told that they w<sup>d</sup> not release the British prisoners &amp; that they had men enough to conquer all their enemies. &ndash; Mrs B thanks your sister for her letter  &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">You may direct to me if you write in a fortnight under cover to Sir Rob<sup>t</sup> Salusbury MP Clifton  &ndash; He is a friend a personal friend of Pitt’s, but is gone to vote for  peace &amp; he thinks the ministry will be such as to shake the resolution of this prime agent of the Devil in his playful purposes  &ndash;</p> 
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Yrs</p> 

<p>Thomas Beddoes</p> 

<p>You will be glad to hear that Dr Darwin’s book is half printed.  You w<sup>d</sup> not discover by conjecture his manner of treating of diseases.  His is a symptomatologic raisonée does this give you any idea! He treats of symptoms (as they are called) each by itself &ndash; &amp; so has few or none of those groups of symptoms, which as they often occur together, have hitherto been considered as one state or being; in the same manner as any plant or animals is one single being consisting of parts &ndash; How do you think he is for stopping a fever-fit? Shall I tell you &ndash; why, by laying his man on an horizontal mill-stone &amp; whirling it round about 60 times in a minute &ndash; or less according to the circumstances of the stone &amp; the man  &ndash; </p>
