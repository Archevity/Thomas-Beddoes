	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to the Printer of <cite>Felix Farley’s Bristol Journal</cite>, 17 March 1803</h2>
	
	


<p style="text-align: center;">TO THE PRINTER.  </p>
<p>Sir, </p>
<p>The Influenza appears to be spreading among us &ndash; No contagious disorder is, I believe, so rapid in its course or so general: This arises from two causes: in the first place, the influenza is exceedingly contagious, and the symptoms, if I mistake not, will shew themselves in 24 hours after the infection is taken. Thus, a medical gentleman, who yesterday saw me with several poor invalids, is to-day, severely affected; and he has every reason to think he caught it then. The same has happened to people from the country, where there was no Influenza. Whole families fall down together, or within two or three days. Yet no one circumstance is common to the members, but residing under the same roof. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The rich will have their own medical attendants; but the middling and lower classes, it is to be feared, will neglect, or, what is worse, endeavour to treat themselves. They will sometimes trust to the foolish recipes, lately communicated through the newspapers, and sometimes adopt the hot regimen: that is, they will set about to produce a sweat by strong stimulating compositions, swallow heated liquors, and keep themselves very warm. This plan will now and then succeed; but beware if it fail: you have a dreadful increase of inflammation, immediate danger perhaps; probably fatal consequences. The very opposite rule, if a general one were to be laid down, is much the safer. When the chest is oppressed, the cough tight, and the skin burning, few will repent of keeping cool, whether up or in bed; but best up, drinking cold liquids, breathing cold air, and living low. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It is true that antimonials, which sometimes create perspiration, are most useful in this, as they have proved in former influenzas. But to give a prescription for all cases, is nearly as hopeless, as to cut a coat which shall fit all the backs in Bristol. Some require to be bled. In others, bleeding will induce a much worse complaint.
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The very young, if attacked, the aged, the consumptive, the puny and the infirm in general, will suffer severely, and even be cut off immediately or in the end. In medicine, indeed, there are resources, which if properly employed, will prevent this calamity. &ndash; But how desirable to present the necessity of employing them if possible! This may be attempted in two ways, though not with the same expectation as in contagions that sink less quickly. But we shall often succeed. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">1. <em>Separate those members of a family for whom the worst is to be feared, as soon as the disorder appears</em>. With these let neither the infected nor their attendants, have communication. Let everything used or worn by the sick be immediately put into water. In short let all the rules for preventing fevers from spreading be observed. Perhaps the influenza appears so infectious, because so little care is taken to prevent its spreading, when once in a family. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">2. Of the second method I cannot speak with full assurance. I have advised it because I feel that confidence in it, which the closest analogy is calculated to inspire. On board our ships, in our hospitals, in private houses, as also in France and Spain, the fumes of the nitrous and marine acids have at once destroyed different species of febrile contagion. The most fatal maladies have been arrested in their progress as soon as these fumes have been called into action. I cannot believe that the contagion of the influenza will resist such powerful agents. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I cannot here give the evidence in favour of mineral acid fumigations, nor the preparation of the different mixtures. But if a gallipot with one or two ounces of oil of vitriol be kept blood-warm, and half a tea-spoonful of common salt or salt-petre added now and then, the protective fumes will be given out. They need but be barely sensible, not irritating.  The room where the sick are should not be fumigated, if the fumes excite coughing. A gallipot should be placed in the apartment of the uninfected, and also in the passage leading to it. Polished steel should be removed or oiled. </p>
