	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt, 26 March 1807</h2>
	
	
<p>My dear Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have never forgotten that I am indebted to you in an answer to y<sup>r</sup> friendly enquiries.  I delayed it from the hope of being able to say something satisfactory. I have never been confined; but in common with my neighbours, had attempts at severe colds repeatedly since the beginning of y<sup>e</sup> year &ndash; but threw them off sooner than many others did. I found myself easily fatigued &amp; in walking up hill proceed slowly from necessity &ndash; I do not find any analogy between the circumstances you were so good as to point out &amp; my affection &ndash; I have no cough whatever &ndash; scarcely when I have as great a cold as I ever do get &ndash; Universal chronic rheumatism I am hourly sensible of &ndash; but it amounts to little more than the ache of fatigue &amp; I can bring it on in any voluntary muscle by merely contracting that muscle strongly. But I had this in a considerable degree before being laid up last year &ndash; That the liver is diseased I know from occasional pain &amp; visible deficiency of bile &ndash; &amp; there is certainly some disorder of y<sup>e</sup> heart, added to adhesion &amp; thickenings of the lungs &ndash; so that the same scene must be renewed &amp; with a diff<sup>t</sup> event &ndash; But I can have no sort of depression of spirits &ndash; Mrs Beddoes had got better than for years &ndash; but a young brother crossed her &amp; her endeavours to amuse him have thrown her sadly back  &ndash; The children are well &ndash; Mr Edgeworth I hear is going to lose a daughter the flower of his flock by consumption   I judge from very imperfect acct<sup>s</sup> that she is near the last stage &ndash; Dr Gregory  is her physician. This will be the 5<sup>th</sup> female, I think, so carried off in that family  &ndash; </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I do not know whether you have heard the same alarm from mad dogs as we have &ndash; I do not think ours was false or excessive  &ndash; I have seen several animals in a state of violent &amp; fatal disease after the bite of a suspected dog &ndash; a dog is now confined here under the symptoms &ndash; 2 cows, some pigs &amp; a horse, as I certainly know, died &ndash; Mr King carefully dissected a cow &amp; horse &ndash; There was inflammation of the most violent kind at the fauces &ndash; no disease below y<sup>e</sup> diaphragm &ndash; But this excessive inflammation is, as you know, not universal in the genera of animals &ndash; I &amp; others saw the symptoms just as described &ndash; &amp; they were seen to be bitten &ndash; so the evidence is very compleat &ndash; In my opinion our medical police wants reformation But I do not see on what grounds an order for the long confinement of dogs shall be given out &amp; enforced. Shall the magistrates be obliged on the requisition of any person to procure an examination of those who may have seen a suspected dog by two medical men &amp; on their concurrence in an opinion of his madness to give notice to keep up dogs for 3 months under a penalty of ten pounds for every dog seen at large &ndash; Mrs B joins in compt<sup>s</sup> to you &amp; Mrs &amp; Mr James Watt &ndash; I am </p>
