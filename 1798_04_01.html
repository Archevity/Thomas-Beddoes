	<h2>Thomas Beddoes to James Watt and James Watt Jr, 1 April 1798</h2>
	
	

 <p> Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I ought to give the projector some acc<sup>t</sup> of the chemical concern here as it is now set on foot.   Two lectures have been given &amp; as far as I know extremely well received. One was an acc<sup>t</sup> of Physics to point out the relation &amp; bearing of chemistry to the other branches. The other historical &ndash; In this which was last nights business the Herculaneum glass  figured &amp; the audience as you will suppose was most extremely struck by the exhibition. I shewed it very minutely; but did not trust it out of my own paws &ndash; It shall be returned this week. I certainly consider the loan as an high obligation. In the 1st lecture Alston  was shewn &ndash; It figured extremely well &ndash; Not one I believe of the chemists present guessed its composition &amp; I declared I w<sup>d</sup> not tell them.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The operator  appears to me quite master of his business &amp; laborious &ndash; I know not if it can be required that he sh<sup>d</sup> be ingenious in devising new exp<sup>s</sup> &ndash; Though it is desirable he sh<sup>d</sup> be I have not ascertained whether he has this species of talent. But he certainly goes through all the processes of the new chemistry with dexterity &ndash; I confess the first week he gave me a bad impression of himself &ndash; but I believe he is really modest.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As to numbers they are not ascertained &ndash; I left the doors open these two lectures with<sup>t</sup> however declaring y<sup>m</sup>  open lectures &ndash; The place  which w<sup>d</sup> hold on cramming 170 or perhaps 180 was full but not crowded &ndash; they told me it w<sup>d</sup> not have held above 6 more without close-sitting &amp; I know of that no. who were absent. But the number of tickets yet given out does not account nearly to this no. &ndash; I hope I shall have the chemical lamp in a week or fortnight.  Do you or Mr Boulton want any chemicals prepared? I know not if you keep an operator general at Soho. </p>
	<p style="margin-left:40px;">I am D<sup>r</sup> Sir<br>
	Your obliged friend </p>

 <p>Thomas Beddoes</p>

 <p>1 April</p>


 <p>PS much medical occupation has hindered me from digesting a syllabus &ndash; something to put them in possession of the new nomenclature &amp; the old I must print  &ndash; I have had a patient undoubtedly venereal from his birth &amp; with<sup>t</sup> primary affection ever. That is his mother had no chancre when he was born &ndash; much relieved &amp; will be I hope cured by nitrous acid.  If you think any probability applicable to n. acid or oxyg<sup>d</sup> muriate  arises from your experience &amp; can draw up a precis within three weeks I sh<sup>d</sup> be glad. </p>

 <p>For Mr Watt Sen<sup>r</sup></p>

 <p>D<sup>r</sup> Sir</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">If you have too much on hand to attend to such a petty business as a caoutchouc transferring tube  &ndash; will you lend me your old one?  I hope to send you the 4 &lt;very close&gt; printed sheets on nitrous acid soon; they are composed but a printer’s mutiny in London has hindered their being worked off  &ndash; I know that some very important cases of gouty stomach &amp;c have yielded &ndash; Mr Barr did give me hopes (&amp; Dr Carmichael too) that they w<sup>d</sup> favour me with some unfavourable cases  &ndash; w<sup>d</sup> to God they w<sup>d</sup>! I shall be ashamed to publish only success &ndash; In the regiments here they will now use this acid &ndash; One most splendid cure where 2 or 3 drachms of mercurial ointment has dreadfully affected the patient &ndash;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am yrs truly</p>

 <p>Thomas Beddoes </p>
